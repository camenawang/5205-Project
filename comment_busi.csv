There is nothing to any of this fear and anxiety: no big crisis in any single video - it's just brain manipulation. I'm tired of watching my stomach tighten just reading the videos so I don't want them in my feed. The content is decent - as it always has been - but in the last six months or so I would say Graham has shifted from providing peak value respectfully to manipulating his audience and using his audience for his income: hence the upsurge in fear and drama with a reduced concentration of truly relevant content. I think Graham could create a steadier burn and justify the channel doing one video a week on something that really mattered, enjoying life more and cutting the FUD.",2021-01-21 23:48:02

Electrical Arc and Safety. The charger cable is (obviously) supplying electricity to the car's internal charge circuitry. A rather significant amount of current (Amps) is required, and suddenly connecting/disconnecting a plug while that much ""juice"" is flowing can lead to sparks/shock (standing in a puddle in your driveway while it's raining?) and the electrical arc will damage the plug, either dramatically all at once, or gradually over time and repetition.
This is purely speculation. I've been working on cars for 27 years, and electronics and PCs have been a hobby for even longer. I would imagine a fair bit of the price of a Tesla boils down to engineering. (I make that assumption partly on the overabundance of tech where simple mechanicals would suffice - glove compartment door, for example...) I would also assume that the engineers designing the charging circuit would plan a few different ""cut-offs"" for the charging to address safety concerns, pranks, and longevity of the charging port/integrity of the connection during a charge cycle. Those are the types of things I would think of if I were in their shoes.",2020-10-19 03:20:34

Limited range was your big screw up, as you have found out - especially trying to use the car in LA as a real estate developer.  The old adage is true, ""Quality in the beginning is savings in the end.""  I would have taken the white seats, maximum range, and pretty much any color except grey, white, or black.  Or I would have paid to get the car painted or wrapped, as you apparently did.  The wrap looks nice, but your lifetime cost there probably is close to the $2k red paint job.

"Ugw5AKhkX-NmR0uIeuh4AaABAg","UCU9pcclBvcdD-a7eVRMAZmw","Charles Nuno","Things to add that we've learned after 2 years of ownership:
1) The Tesla has a 12V battery in the frunk area, similar to your standard ICE. Having done some research after having ours die, it serves a crucial role to the car. Unfortunately, in our case, it renders the car completely inoperable until it is replaced and there is no option to just jump start the battery like on an ICE car. Apparently the car is supposed to warn you when the battery is near dead, but our car did no such thing. And Apparently the battery pack is supposed to recharge the 12V with a DC to DC converter, but again...ours did not do that. Luckily, our car was under warranty for this and Tesla covered it all for free....the repair, replacement, tow and even paid for the Uber to pick me up when the car was done.
2) Full Autonomous auto-pilot is a joke at that price. I guarantee you Tesla will perfect it and will initially try and sell it for a ridiculous price, only to have other EV manufacturers sell the feature for much less when the tech becomes more common. There is just no justifying that price unless you absolutely love looking like a show off. 
3) On about 3 occasions, we have had the screen go completely blank or pixelize and become useless. The car would still drive, but all of your ancillary functionality is immediately lost until the system reboots. Kind of a vulnerable feeling because you don't know what else is going to shut off during that time. Although the minimalist approach can seem attractive, having absolutely everything tied to the touch screen definitely has its drawbacks.",2020-09-03 18:11:57

Usually, people will say nonsense like how they regret not getting their Tesla in a different color. Or how the rims scratch easily.

So here I am again, abandoning this video before the 2 minute mark.
He already lost me when he said he was not going for the YouTube sensationalism when literally his title says, ""the TRUTH about the Model 3"". Caps included.

You also failed to mention that charging at home will be at least half the cost of gasoline, in some places it could be just 1/5 the price of gas to go the same no. of miles. Also no tuneups, no oil changes, almost no brake jobs because of regen braking.  Also insane acceleration.  All around just a fun car to drive.  Love my model S LR+ with an EPA range of 402 miles.

Some states and countries allow recording of audio with video, but it usually is fairly uncommon too. I do a lot CCTV work in New Jersey, and the usual work around is if you are ""actually a part of the conversation"", you can record audio. This means if you are actively watching the camera and are able to respond to whomever is near the camera with a microphone. I am not sure about laws in other states, but I assume some are stricter than that and would require a bit more in depth research. I have some thoughts as to how Tesla could approach this, but it would probably only resolve the issue for some states and countries and most likely cause the battery to drain faster.",2020-07-25 00:45:30

That's only an issue for states that are known as ""Two-Party Consent States"" like for example Florida, but for states that are known as ""One Party Consent States"" like for example New York then it is not an issue.  As long as at least one party of a conversation is ok with the recording than its a legal court admissible recording.  However, there could be some ""gray area"" where if you capture an audio conversation where you are not the party of a conversation that is happening within a group of person but for that, you would need to speak with a lawyer just to clear things up and make sure if in that case, it's legal because you own the vehicle and you gave consent to that recording happening.  

* The one and two-party content laws are more geared to phone conversations, but I don't see how it cannot be extended into a video conversation especially if you are a party to that conversation 

* This is not legal advice, I provide this info as-is.  Do your own research to be 100% sure if in your own particular case your recordings can be defended with the ""One-Party Consent"" Doctrine.",2020-07-17 06:54:06

Sounds like requirement to open the door when charging is to stop the plug from being stolen or an idiot that thinks it would be funny to pull it out while charging. Pretty much states what he doesn't like is how the like of apple etc have made their billions, on selling or up selling, pay us a monthly fee that you're possibly already paying someone else for a similar service, eg data etc.  Maybe an alternative self driving car would be the better comparison, eg vovlo, bmw, merc etc etc. Also, Musk has a track record of this is going to happen by xyz, but in reality, much like star trek etc, the technology is still many many years off, but I'm sure (like apple gets credit for certain things) Musk fans will always credit Musk for these promised features down the track.",2020-07-13 06:02:50

One day I was in the pool side Browsing and thinking where I can go get a solution.

If you did not buy the package for streaming music then you must use your phone to pair and steam music using your phone data sharing feature.
While this is still great as a workaround it seems that stupid things happen that should not happen at all.
While the car is in park and you then connect your phone for data sharing so streaming music can be played then the following happens.
You put the car from park into reverse......   Wifi will be automatically disabled.  So then you put the car into drive then turn on the wifi yet again to connect to streaming.
Drive condition should NEVER affect WIFI choice!

Second.  We love our Tesla cart so much we always want the car connected to WIFI once the car is parked for the day at home so you connect your car to your home wifi.
So far so great yes?      Yes but it seems if you are a hard core gamer and you play any MMO game with the tesla connected to your home wifi network
then you just might start seeing a lot of lag.   
Yeah so your Tesla will be a game killer if you are into a lot of PVP.
So if you know you will be doing a lot of PVP battles then when still in the car then just turn off your Tesla wifi.",2020-07-09 15:06:43

I have wavered for a while due to the instability of the fearless leader and I suspect some disinformation from other vested interests ""coz that's how they roll"" just ask em about how they handle lawsuits! I also am dubious about the OTA which could nobble the car with a bad update or if it decides it is not a genuine car due to  some glitch in the software and shut me out of the system. 
Also I live in Adelaide South Australia where 45 degree C days are common in summer. Not a lot of data about how much mileage gets lost to cooling on a hot day when driving or parked. I was surprised to see how much underspray there was on your car. Very poor when compared to even a basic conventional car. At the end of the day, after a few whangs at  a shopping centre, a concours finish is not high on my list but I do expect full coverage fort the protection aspect.  Prices in OZ are not as encouraging either thanks to the exchange rate. Drive away price on a base Model 3 with no options is $79,087 AUD. We do get some discount on stamp duty and luxury tax but the difference over a normal car would buy a lot of fuel and the break even point would be well over 100,000 kilometres. 
If I had the money, I would still buy one for the driving experience and the novelty especially if I had home solar. I would still keep my diesel for the long  trips. I have no ambition to go on a roadtrip with an EV until they bring out the hyped million mile battery with enough range to drive all day and recharge overnight at my destination. A lot of places in Oz where infrastructure is thin on the ground between capitals.",2020-07-05 04:33:52

In fact very little cars make financial sense, they all depreciate and they all cost us money. It's just a sunk cost we have to accept. But the Tesla is no better in this regard. The only real savings is gas, which is more than offset by the higher payment. Buy a Tesla if you want but dont expect to be writing off expenses to the point that it costs you $78/month to own one.

I mean No car company would give all season mats, the point of charging plug lock  is for someone to not pull the plug when ur not there. if u are too lazy to unlock it then you shouldnt buy tesla and any other car because in other cars u will have the problem of filling the gas, and with your laziness it will be hard for you honey.  He is blaming supercharges because they are not fast enough to charge when ur in rush, ohh god cmon then dont buy fucking tesla go get gas car, or charge your car earlier, its a common problem in all electric cars, and no other electric car brand has super charger, so u gotta charge ur car to full in 7 hours minimum with other cars, you are just being so stupidly dumb and trying to find reasons to critisize this car. Tell me a reason that u cannot find in this car and can find in other cars, Let me tell u by being an owner of tesla model 3. This car doesnt have sun roof , I dont use much so its not a problem for me, but it might be problem for some other people so it is a valid reason to critisize. It could be full glass + you can open the roof. The other thing about the car I hate is, the card reader is on the side  and only on the driver side and u have to pay $150 extra to buy car key to unlock or lock the car remotly,( or u can use the app for free but u need internet connection). The glovebox thing, if u were put the button there, u wouldnt be here to get views by critisizing Tesla in your stupid video, you would be an UI expert in your own business or big companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. I dont care how u like tesla or the company or elon, ur so miserable that you just use the companies reputation with stupid lies and trying to get views likes, ur disgusting.",2020-06-22 16:51:32

On a more serious note, I'm in a very similar boat to Graham (minus about a million net worth, hah), as soon as the SR+ was available in Canada I jumped on it. Doing the numbers against my Dodge Charger, with only 40% down it was the exact same monthly cost, and no risk of a transmission bricking itself, or any of the other risks of driving an old gas car. I never thought I'd buy a new car, but it just made sense. Especially since we had a $10,000 incentive here in Canada. My only real annoyance is how little features you could get from Tesla, but some have come after as post-delivery options, such as rear heated seats. Other options I modded in, like premium audio and ambient lighting. Only ended up costing me a little over a grand.",2020-06-13 18:47:19

1. Problems disconnecting the charging cable.  I had this problem too.  When I first had the car, it seemed to work fine: press the button and the charging stopped and I could remove the cable.  Later, for some reason, I had the same problem as you: I had to open a door or unlock the charging port with my phone.  However, over the last week (it is now 13th June, 2020), it is working fine.  Maybe resolved with recent software releases? ¬†

2. Having to press two buttons to open the glove box.  This (along with many other menu items) is solved with voice commands.  Just press the right button on the steering wheel and say ""Open the glove box"". ¬†

3. Full self driving cost.  I agree, it is a lot of money for the current features, but I am getting more features all the time.  I now have stopping at traffic lights and stop signs, which still needs some tweaking, but is an excellent step towards full self driving.  I think it is also a bit confusing the way you refer to Autopilot and full self driving interchangeably.  AP comes free with the car and does a great job on highways and well marked roads.  Many people would be very satisfied with this and it will have the positive impact on driver fatigue that you mentioned. ¬†

I¬¥d like to compare the Price of the car in US and Europe (Spain) according with Tesla webpage. My choise is this car

‚Ä¢	Model 3 Long Range Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive$46,990
‚Ä¢	Pearl White PaintIncluded
‚Ä¢	19‚Äô‚Äô Sport Wheels$1,500
‚Ä¢	All Black Premium InteriorIncluded
‚Ä¢	Purchase Price in u¬°USA     $48,490
Excluding taxes and fees

Same car in Europe. (Spain)  $69,300  taxes included
We pay 10% tariff plus 21% VAT for the car.
Out of curiosity. How much do you pay in taxes and fees in USA for the same car?
I think that the different of prices for the same car is insane.",2020-06-12 09:52:08

You should be able to tether your car to your phone over Wifi (phone as a WiFi hot spot).

For long road trips, don't charge to 100%.  The last 5% takes a long time due to battery physics.  The built in route planner will optimize this for you.  It's never necessary to spend more than 20 to 30 minutes to Supercharger on a long road trip, especially given that most superchargers on long distance highways are about 100 miles apart.

As you note, for most daily driving, most people charge at home and never use a public charger.

I had to take it in twice for suspension issues that Tesla fixed for free because it was under warranty. The build quality on mine was okay other than some trim pieces they had to correct after living with it for a month and noticing it. Other than that it was a cool car, yet I could tell that the construction of it isn't made the best in terms of quality. Any AWD car costs more to maintain just because there are more components and if anything thats where your gonna see your problems down the line. Owning a Tesla out of warranty seems like a bad idea (do your research on this as there are plenty of Youtube videos on it). Sadly, I didn't wanna fall into the Tesla trap of always having a car note just so I can have a Tesla under warranty because its equivalent to a Ferrari or even more depending on the issue. The cars are unfortunately ahead of their time because nobody can repair them at a fair price nor repair them in a decent amount of time just yet. Tesla has a long way to go for making it worth the average persons time and money to own one out of warranty so I traded mine in and was offered 42K on a 2019 AWD with 18K miles. I went back to a petrol car and even though its not as cool as the Tesla in some regards, its better in the long run since I don't plan on keeping a car note just because of the worry of something going wrong.",2020-06-09 17:15:36

Sometimes the auto function triggered by having the phone in your pocket as you approach the car doesn't work. I recently discovered that, if that happens,  it's easy enough to manually unlock by pulling out the phone and finding this feature on the app. But the question remains .. why the inconsistency? Why doesn't the auto feature work EVERY TIME (imagine if the same inconsistency was applied to the Space X rocket?). In short, we expect more of Tesla. Along the same lines, most of the time the key card (if one has to use it in place of the phone auto-entry or phone manual entry) is unreliable to effect the required response. I have had to 'Tap' it against the outside sensor multiple times (on several occasions) to get it to ""open the damn door"". Other negatives for me are the wiper controls on the screen (they require you to take your eyes off the road for too long to get the setting you need) and the temperature control and 'fan' features' (same problem).

Just like when you have health issues and you go the dr.. get a honest auto tech or have one as a friend and follow his advise.

One could imagine that it all revolves around money. More electric cars equals billions lost in gas taxes, which equals less funding for highway repairs (which the electric cars will still utilize)... Auto driving equals less accidents (which is great), but this would equal less needs for tow trucks, auto repair shops, parts manufactures, parts delivery companies, auto part stores, cheaper insurance companies, not to mention ambulance chasing lawyers..

Awful paint jobs, scratches & knicks, and inner door oddities are all not supposed to be there.  That‚Äôs not acceptable when you purchase a brand new car.

These guys are so lucky btw. Yes Graham, you will get the Roadster for free which is a no brainer because of your FREE money you make off of YouTube. But Joe Rogan who will be the number 2 guy on the list smoked weed with Elon Musk on his podcast and he was just on his podcast this time and OMG Joe Rogan is making so much cash that it makes me sick to know that you and Meet Kevin and Ryan Serhant were studs for raking in the cash AKA millions in the bank and easy money. But Rogan is moving to Spotify and telling YouTube and Apple to go pound sand and good for him. He won't be an announcer for much longer as his buddy Mike Goldberg got canned when his alcohol and drug problems caught up with him and Uncle Dana White kicked him to the curb. Rogan no longer needs the UFC, Dana White or silly shows like the Fear Factor from back in the day when he broke into the biz. But going back to the Roadster, there is going to be a few token people that everyone knows that will get this car and thank God it won't be fricken Kylie Jenner because that would give the brand a bad name and she would most likely kill herself driving from Calabasas to Las Vegas and trying to go 255mph from Barstow to Baker on that beautiful stretch of straight line that seems to end way to fast for me anyways, as I only did 165 in my 2010 BMW M3 V8. I was going to get a Tesla but I can't stand the no sound. In my M3 I had to not blast the music with the Harmon Kardon stereo system because that V8 and the 7spd DCT just made me feel so good and that addictiveness the sound BMW use to make in my brain waves was absolutely magical. Not to mention I gave a ride to Tony Robbins and to see him smile made me smile and he loves BMW's and he got into an accident way, way back when he use to drive the 745Li and it saved his life. Anyway, this car looks bad ass and I know it is the car to own and I feel bad for the foolish people who think a Toyota Prius, Honda Civic Hybrid or any other car does them justice somehow. Graham if you get the Roadster after you give a ride to Kevin, I would love to be a passenger in your new ride next year. I am more than willing to drive up from San Diego to your neck of the woods and perhaps we may run into Joe or Jay driving around Los Angeles in their new Roadsters as well. That would be way too cool because you know Jay would definitely want to race us in a heartbeat, Joe Rogan we would have to flip him off to get his attention, J/K, never flip off a man who can kick your ribs in, into your lungs.

"UgzR4As3ULxKVemz5MR4AaABAg","UCauHcNMfDgZG-r0gZn1ZcCQ","Real HIFI Help","I would never buy a tesla because of these things:
1. They are only a steal in the US, in europe we pay way more for them.
2. They are constantly connected to the web/gps. (not safe, plus you can in theory get hacked when you drive in the future)
3. I find it amazing not more people mentioning that, when you have a Tesla, you do not in fact own it after the circa 5 year warranty. What I mean by that is that, it is only allowed that you then pay Tesla to fix the car and only Tesla can provide the parts. This may sound sweet and innocent, but it means that you end of paying at least 2-5x more for repairing it.
4. It has so many moving/modern parts that you will have to go like 2-5x more to get small bugs fixed that do not get fixed with the update.
5. Tesla and the government can't track where you are and where you drove the car. (no privacy)
6. If the screen get's black or does not work, you do not have AC and you cannot see how fast you are going.
7. I do not trust the car card/key solution, it seems like something that easily can be hacked if you really researched it.
8. Teslas are also known for having really cheap interior that looks cool and it comfortable, but simply doesn't last like a normal car. Expect wear and tear of seat within like 1/3 of normal seats in normal cars.
9. Also what happens when the battery dies out after the warranty, most electric cars cost about 10.000 dollars to fix that, some even 30.000 dollars. I would not want to have to deal with that.
So all in all, yes it is a fun/cool/practical car.
But having an EV myself, I can tell you that, when you recharge at these fast rates, you have to expect the battery being killed 2-3 times faster. 150-250kw reharging rate is seriously going to kill a lot of batteries. I only recharge at 50kw with my car, and I can already feel after 2 years how it reduces my range.
Also it has to be mentioned that, if you have any EV car and you fast charge it 1-3 times everyday, and you have a very hot climate, that battery is just toast within the first 5 years, absolutely guaranteed. And yes many do cover that. But also a really problem is that most manufactors only cover up to 100.000 miles battery guarantee, this is horribly low.
My personal experience is that the tesla 3 is a good car for people in the city that recharge at home in the US, yes if you are in that category and like most people in the world do not care about your privacy and want all the newest functions, then fine the car is a good purchase.
I just want to enlighten people and tell them that, what the tesla is doing with the tesla 3, is basically what has happened going from old to new laptops. We lease, we have cool features and we get rid of the car around year 5, which actually is pretty bad for the environment. So personally living in europe, I just use my nissan leaf car because I know from several owners that it will last for a much longer time.",2020-06-06 08:40:59

Sure it reflects the true cost of ownership BUT one can get a tax deduction on ANY vehicle so it's not like Tesla is a special case in that regard BUT it IS a special case that you get the government handout just for buying it. 

What's the cost of ownership without the government funding and tax write off. 

Personally I'm sick of the government picking winners and losers and this seems to be happening in all industries....especially with car makers.....seems every 10 years they get bailed out and that is NOT capitalism........would Tesla even be viable without government tax credits AND bogus carbon credit trading?",2020-06-06 03:41:01

So if you got about 50 thousand dollars from the video about the Model 3, and then I assume at least 10 thousand from selling Tesla stocks, then you could just get sell the Standard Range Model 3 and get the Long Range Dual Motor, maybe even the Long Range Performance if you made more than 20k in Tesla stocks, and it would be like nothing happened. The SR would sell for at least 25 or 30k, maybe even more. You spent 35k originally, so subtract that from the 60k, and you're at 25k. Add the 30k from selling the car, and you're back at 55k, which is almost exactly the cost of the Long Range Dual Motor. Or you could just get a Model Y. A Long Range Model Y is 53k with White Seats and no Full Self Driving. Get a Model Y Graham. *Edit:* A Long Range Model 3 is actually 48k with white seats.

More so if you drive it like your grandparents, think about the area under the curve of the total power input/output rate of the battery pack.   The largest battery pack available would also reduce the effective discharge/charge rate significantly, which is probably the most effective way to get the most life out of the battery pack; consider though out of the gate the OEMs design the battery pack with conservative charge/discharge rates, GM has an 8-year warranty on the Volt packs for example this is how they do it.
California would be an ideal climate to use the car because some of the tesla charger power output would be used to run the cooling system to keep the battery cells in the ""happy"" temperature outside in hot climates and cold climates; of course a climate controlled garage could solve that.",2020-06-05 23:25:41

Let me start by providing value!if you encouraged ppl to increase their watch speed on your videos from 1X to like 1.25X or 1.5X would that increase actual watch time and help the algorithm? Also You‚Äôve inspired me to start my own YouTube channel bro! I bought your course and it‚Äôs been awesome! I had a question though! I have about 2 small videos up right now that have nothing to do with my upcoming channel talking about real estate investing and personal finance. Should I delete them and start over (only have 6 subs right now) or should I create a new Gmail all together for this specific channnel? My current channel is connected to my most used gmail for business and personal stuff. Thank you! And congrats on 2 mil!

Billionares like Bezo,""45 and ""smart people"" like you, payes under 1000$ in federal and local taxes, while I as an electrician, pay allmost 36.000$ a year, as an honest citizen without any taxevations.

The vast majority of the time they would be pointless extra bulk. Panels need to be perfectly aligned to the sun at a specific angle to work at maximum efficiency. Car roofs are curved, so at any given moment only part of the panel would be optimally aligned. Cars drive under trees, in the shade of buildings etc. Just not worth the cost and weight. What would be worthwhile were solar canopies in parking lots everywhere. The panels could trickle charge a car when one was under them, and feed the grid or whichever office, shop or business they were outside when they were unoccupied. Imagine going to work, parking under a solar roof, plugging in and at the end of the day having enough free power added to drive home at zero cost to you or the environment.

Absolutely rubbish. In a home environment you are limited by whatever breaker you decide to install in your panel. Your stove is 40Amp and your dryer is 30Amp. I am an electrical engineer and I also happen to own a Tesla.  I've installed my charger off of the same fused 30A disconnect I use for my dryer, which in turn is fed by a 30Amp breaker in my panel. My car, for all intents and purposes, charges in 1/4 the time it takes off of the regular 120 V 15 A charging circuit.  Of course the output of the power supply is time variant/switching DC capable of just cutting the total output DC current in half. You asked how fast it charges at 220V as opposed to 110V, I answered you. I guess I could have told you that it's up to you, but instead I told you the rate at which mine actually charges, and why.",2020-09-18 17:32:10

This would give prospective buyers a better sense of how much extra time a trip home to see their parents 600 miles away will cost them. 

Of course, your driving habits will impact range a lot too, and there's no way automakers can account for that.

So the Autopilot is never in full control, the driver is. Tesla does not have Level 5 autonomy, which entails no human intervention or human in the loop. You can't say Autopilot is safer than the average driver when Autopilot is not even capable of driving by itself. Which is why Tesla's claims are complete and unsubstantiated horseshit. The day a Tesla can drive from anywhere to anywhere, in any conditions and all weather, without a human having to intervene or touch any controls, and once it does that for a few tens if millions of combined miles with 99.9999% reliability is the day Tesla can use that data to compare it to the average driver.

Maybe it will someday, but definitely not yet, and it pisses me off royally when I see people sleeping or sitting in the wrong seat instead of controlling the car. But a standard Tesla with Autopilot is far better than what you're describing here. Autopilot in heavy rain and faintly marked roads is much more reliable than my Honda CRV on a perfectly marked highway on a sunny day. Does Elon Musk brag and exaggerate? You bet.

Autopilot is a glorified cruise control with lane assist. You can get that in a Hyundai and even a Honda Civic these days. All it can do is maintain speed and adapt to traffic and stay in a lane under perfect conditions and well marked lanes. That constitutes about 5% of driving scenarios. And Tesla only pulls data for highway driving (which is the only place that Autopilot can be used) and compares it to national averages for ALL driving. Most accidents happen in city driving not on a highway. So of course Tesla will claim it's safer, because Autopilot does NOT work in city driving. The numbers they show are cherrypicked and biased. And they say the driver is always responsible for the vehicle. How can Autopilot be safer than a human driver if it requires constant monitoring and supervision and intervention by a human if it goes off the rails? Do you have a professional driver riding shotgun with you all the time ready to take over when you screw up? No, you don't. Tesla's assertions are pure hogwash with no supporting data. It's just propaganda to rake in $8000 from each sucker customer for a piece of software that doesn't yet exist. I dare you to go from one destination to another in your Tesla (a real route, not just 50 feet down your street) without ever touching the controls. What's that? You can't? Because the car can't do it? That's what I thought. In the meantime, stop spreading misinformation and lies about how 'safe' Autopilot is.

You are right though, things like ball joints and wheel bearings definitely still need maintenance but you also get rid of oil changes, spark plugs n wires, engine air filters, fuel filters, pumps, and so on. Tesla's have less moving parts in general",2020-06-06 02:10:19

The tesla gearbox is very simple, it's just a single speed with a reduction gear so theres not much to go wrong. They purposely  overbuilt it because they want to have a fleet ride sharing taxi network. You just do wiper fluid, tires, and cabin air filters. Brakes will last at least twice as long because of regen braking (electric motor acting as a generator to use your forward momentum to spin the motor and recharge the battery with that energy). I literally don't use my breaks at all and thats not driving like a granny coasting for a mile, you can actually drive quite aggressively up to stop signs etc and the regen is enough to slow you no problem. Only exception is emergency stops. Pretty great cars, high starting price though but I'd say its worth it as long as it fits your family need etc.",2020-06-06 02:09:37

Only real maintenance is basic suspension and tires that any shop can do. Then ever 50k miles you need to flush the coolant, but I've known a few people who do it themselves so I assume shops could too. Only thing you need to go to a Tesla dealer for is when you have problems with the motors or batteries (which is very rare in the newer models) and then you can schedule it all from the Tesla app.

As a gear head, the Model 3 ruined all other cars for me. I still appreciate high end ICE cars, but I hope to never go back to driving one everyday.",2020-06-06 05:44:59

A lot of the Tesla enthusiasts are really more tech enthusiasts, rather than car enthusiasts. I used to be obsessed with Tesla's myself, but then switched to being much more of a car enthusiast. I still find them to be interesting vehicles, but they've taken much lower on my priority list than they once were. There's a lot of other cars out there that are more enthusiast oriented than a Tesla.

It was a weird and interesting experience meeting another Tesla tech enthusiast in real life (this was after I made the transition from Tesla enthusiast to car enthusiast). He was happy to talk about the ins and outs of Tesla vehicles to no end, but as soon as I mentioned another car I could tell I had lost him in an instant.

Not that I'm trying to say there's anything wrong with Tesla tech enthusiasts, but it's amazing to see how drastically different they are from the rest of the car community.",2020-06-05 23:37:33
