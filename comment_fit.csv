I feel you. I was like that too as I was embarrassed to exercise in front of my family as I was afraid of them judging me, but when they finally discovered what I was doing, they didn’t judge me at all, in fact they encouraged me, my dad especially, he told me how proud he was of me. Now I do Chloe’s workouts in the living room in front of everyone and I don’t even care, they’re not even watching me, they have better things to do! It’s much less stressful if you don’t try to hide, and there’s so much more space so I can actually complete the exercises properly. 
So basically the point is, don’t be scared or ashamed to exercise in front of your family, they shouldn’t judge you for trying to better yourself!! <3",2020-05-08 12:51:27

I'm tired, but primarily because I don't sleep enough (single mom syndrome).

Yesterday was an active rest day, I did yoga and went kayaking and swimming with my kids.

Today I'm feeling very unmotivated, like I just want to snack and watch tv all day, but I've convinced myself to just friggin do it. I know I will be proud of myself when I'm done. 

I've lost like three lbs, but I feel so much stronger, and a little less lumpy. Almost halfway through and if I can keep it up I imagine the results will probably be significant.",2021-02-01 15:27:02

Now I'm trying to start this challenge again on Monday (today), and I'm really pushing myself because fitness it's definitely not something I enjoy doing much but I'm done feeling bad about my body and beating myself for it.

Another great tip is whenever you feel too tired to do the exercise, instead of stopping altogether, do a few circle walks. (yknow walk in a circle) it helps with breathing, keeping you active and helping your muscles stay fit!

Today (11/5/20) is my first day and I started with this warm up. Ooooh boy was I breathing hard lmaoooo XD Hopefully this gets easier as time passes by. I'll be documenting my progress through comments! Wish me luck!

Don't compare your body with someone elses'...Just know that you are struggling to be a better version of yourself..

My body wants to vomit and die but I got through it. Also did part of the Cooldown but my body doesn't handle that at all so I stopped. Still, proud that I'm starting this even though it's not for myself. Unfortunately couldn't do all the exercises in the full body workout so I resorted to jogging in place a lot. I will get through this, lose weight get some muscle and then compare abs with my best friend. Love you lots Mirella. -Dan
Update: I'm currently on day 47 of the 2018 Summer Challenge, I do 4 days a week with 3 rest days and I've been able to keep up without skipping a day so far. Things are getting easier but for some reason my arms are inconsistent, one upperbody day they're in great shape, another I'm having issues with regular pushups again.

After those weeks, I've seen quite some improvement on my body but not that much. I can somehow see abs forminh in my stomach so I wanna make it better and I'm still continuing to do these workouts and now I'm gonna try this new workout program.

So currently, I weigh 57.8kg and I'm gonna see if I can have lesser than that.

I didn't eat much as I used to ( low fat milk for breakfast, a plate of rice and eggs or chicken for lunch and only fruits for dinner) and no junkfood at all. Then I got really sick at the 7th day. My stomach and bones were so sick. So I go back again eating as much as I used to and eating junkfood and sugar every once in a while and continue this workout and I'm okay. So I don't know how to do the clean diet properly. Any suggestion everyone? Ahh I'm 5'4 ft tall with 110lbs.
 Thank you so much! And keep beautiful girls! :)",2020-10-05 02:45:36

But so far I've lost total 9 lbs so far from doing 2019 and 2020 challenge. Ofc I also ate healthy. After 2019 challenge I did cheat so gained 3 lbs but I started 2020 challenge right after cheat day and lost that 3 lbs in 2 days. After finish this 2020 challenge.

Day 1 -  Warm up done, i did this video once before and gave up but for some reason it seems to have gotten easier than I remember (still rly sweaty though) :)
Day 2 -  Warm up done, did one quick break for water and also couldn't do cross jumping jacks because my parents were asleep and I was in the living room so I did the modified version. I also got a door attachable pull up bar for $5 at a yard sale! Time for double booty videos lol
Day 3 - Done! Today was a rest day but i did the warm up to make sure I wouldn't get unmotivated, i only had one quick break for water and my legs were hurting a lot since i was working a lot today but I already feel stronger and faster! (btw i was really insecure while working out today but after looking at progress photos there is already a big difference in my back and stomach!
Day 4 -  warm up done, i feel like death cause i also did the second workout. im shaking, wanna die, and no offense chloe but want you to step on a lego
Day 5 - Rest day! Honestly couldn't be better timing, my legs hurt so bad as I've been working all day today and tomorrow will be worse. Pray for me.
Day 6 -  Warm up done! The only modification was cross jumping jacks (again I did it at night and didn't want to wake my parents up) for once I'm not in pain during the workout or after, while I may be slower, my form is better and I feel a lot better afterwards. It feels like a warmup instead of a full workout. I feel stronger in everyday activities, I notice a change in my body in the pictures (still insecure but hey thats normal) honestly I kind of look forward to the workouts, aka i dread having to do them less, because I take my progress pictures after and it boosts my confidence. My diet wasn't good today, i didn't even track my calories, but im considering today a cheat day and I know I didn't give up because I still continued the workouts! Onto the other vids :)!
Day 7 - Done! Diet was better than yesterday, still not the best but hey im making progress, i had to skip the ab workout due to pain but again a LOT of work was done around the house today :). When I flex I can see a slight (minuscule but still there lol) muscle. I feel stronger every workout and for the first time I followed through with a workout for more than 2 days! :D

I’m not overweight or underweight, I’m actually pretty average.  I just have a tire of fat that makes my fupa look so bad and droopy and my lower back looks so freaking bad it makes my ass look square.  Idk what to do anymore.  I’ve been the same fucking shape for like five fucking years and nothing ever works.  I’m trying to work out to feel good but it’s so goddamn hard when you’ve literally looked the same for so many goddamn years.

Start: 25 aug 2020 ✔
Finish: 21 sept 2020
📌 *DAY 1:  84.1 Kg*
It was so hard. I was taking a lot of rests between them. But in the end I did it after 2 hours instead of 22 min 😂. That was kinda funny to me.
📌 *DAY 2: 83.2 Kg*
I was sweating a looot. I decided to do this workout in the after noun to have more strenght and it really helped me. Cant wait to drink water and get in the shower. 😴
📌 *DAY 3: 82,6 Kg*
Today I trained the arms and it was painful. My left triceps is a lil bit damaged and i didnt sleep well last night. It was kinda easy. Now i am hungry.🤪
📌 *DAY 4: 83,3 Kg* 
Guys, this wad the active rest day so i did some stretching for a full body. I am on my period so i am bloated and i am in pain. But i hope tomorrow it will be a great day. Nothing can stop me.
📌 *DAY 5: 83 Kg*
Today I slept less hours and I ate less than 1000 kcal. That really shows a bad mood and an inability to train. Not to mention that i was angry all day.
📌 *DAY 6: 82,5 Kg* 
Today I felt bad so I decided to switch day 6 with 7, that means today was a rest day. But I hope tomorrow I will be okay. I dont see this as a set back bcs its a looong way to go. Have faith!🕊
📌 *DAY 7: 82,3 Kg*
It was kinda easy but it burnt smth :)) i am concerned that maybe i am in a plateau, but there are still days ahead. Also i started to have red strech marks...😔
📌 *DAY 8: 82,3 Kg*
Today was a rough day for me, bcs of stressing over a upcoming exam and not eating enough, i didnt have the energy and mood to do it. So imma expand this challenge with a day. I will be okay.🕊❤
📌 *DAY 9: 81,9 Kg* 
Today i trained my glutes and hips. It burned, but i enjoyed. I always loved exercises on this area. I ate enough and I had energy to go through this training. 😋
📌 *DAY 10: 82,8 Kg*
I was so sore that I had to switch the days again. So I took care of myself.
📌 *DAY 11: 82,2 Kg*
I am glad I did my training. I actually feel good cuz I ate enough to have energy. I promise to myself to eat cleaner to get to 80 Kg till this challenge ends.🌞",2020-09-04 17:39:26

Start: 25 aug 2020 ✔
Finish: 21 sept 2020
📌 *DAY 1:  84.1 Kg*
It was so hard. I was taking a lot of rests between them. But in the end I did it after 2 hours instead of 22 min 😂. That was kinda funny for me.
📌 *DAY 2: 83.2 Kg*
I was sweating a looot. I decided to do this workout in the after noun to have more strenght and it really helped me. Cant wait to drink water and get in the shower. 😴
📌 *DAY 3: 82,6 Kg*
Today I trained the arms and it was painful. My left triceps is a lil bit damaged cuz i didnt sleep well last night. It was kinda easy. Now i am hungry.🤪
📌 *DAY 4: 83,3 Kg* 
Guys, this wad the active rest day so i did some stretching for a full body. I am on my period so i am bloated and i am in pain. But i hope tomorrow it will be a great day. Nothing can stop me.
📌 *DAY 5: 83 Kg*
Today I slept less hours and I ate less than 1000 kcal. That really shows a bad mood and an inability to train. Not to mention that i was angry all day.
📌 *DAY 6: 82,5 Kg* 
Today I felt bad so I decided to switch day 6 with 7, that means today was a rest day. But I hope tomorrow I will be okay. I dont see this as a set back bcs its a looong way to go. Have faith!🕊
📌 *DAY 7: 82,3 Kg*
It was kinda easy but it burnt smth :)) i am concerned that maybe i am in a plateau, but there are still days ahead. Also i started to have red strech marks...😔",2020-08-31 18:31:48

*Day 1:* Really difficult for me but I feel good about getting exercise
*Day 2:* Super sore today. The workout was difficult again but easier than day 1
*Day 3:* Still a little sore but the arm workouts were easier for me
*Day 4:* Rest day!
*Day 5:* Oof tough workout but I felt stronger
*Day 6:* Felt really unmotivated and tired today but I got through it all
*Day 7:* Rest day!
*Day 8:* Easier workout, felt stronger and I'm starting to see some progress in weight loss
*Day 9:* Not feeling it all. My weight keeps fluctuating so it's really difficult to determine if I'm making any progress. Yesterday I saw some loss but today I just gained it all back
*Day 10:* Feeling good and strong suprisingly
*Day 11:* Rest day!
*Day 12:* Hard workout but I powered through
*Day 13:* Felt strong and I hit all the reps!
*Day 14:* Rest day!
*Day 15:* Did really well with the ab workouts but got really bad stomach pain in the full body afterwards. I got to the end eventually though
*Day 16:* My abs were a bit sore from yesterday but I got through all the videos and reps without taking breaks!
*Day 17:* Rest day! (ended up doing a small workout w/ my sister though)
*Day 18:* Wasn't feeling it today. I had a headache the whole time and struggled to get through some bits
*Day 19:* I felt super sick after the first video so I took an hour off. When I returned the rest of the workout went by fairly smoothly which was good
*Day 20:* I felt sick again like yesterday at first but it wasn't as bad. So I pushed through even though I struggled at some parts. Kind of disappointed that I haven't been feeling strong
*Day 21:* Rest day!
*Day 22:* Starting to feel really frustrated because I'm not seeing any results in weight loss even with dieting and the program.
*Day 23:* Same as yesterday really. I just want to give up at this point.
*Day 24:* In the final stretches. Felt good today
*Day 25:* Rest day!
*Day 26:* Five videos today oof. Felt helpless but I powered through.
*Day 27:* Felt good today, one more day to go!
*Day 28:* Today was super tough but I'm done!",2020-08-01 19:45:20

(This is for me but also anyone reading comments looking for some results 🙃)
01/AUG DAY 1- Finished all work outs, sweating so bad!
02/AUG DAY 2- Not sweating nearly as much as yesterday, but my abs are feeling it 😬
03/AUG DAY 3- My aaarms!  Sweating nicely, eating clean.
04/AUG DAY 4- Rest day, gym and pool session.
05/AUG DAY 5- It's 6 months since my knee operation and I'm so proud of where I am now! I'm noticeably stronger and less love-handley 😄
06/AUG DAY 6- Today was so hard but I did it. I'm still eating clean, this is the biggest challenge of all 🍩
07/AUG DAY 7- Rest day! Usual gym session, enjoyed a tiny bit of processed sugar🍦
08/AUG DAY 8- I hurt my knee, which meant today I had to modify 80% of the workouts, but I still did them all. (For the next few days I will be replacing the full body shred etc with ab/upper body workouts and I will only be using the pool at the gym. Safety first! 👷‍♀️)
09/AUG DAY 9- Did the right number of work out videos (modifying where needed), sweating!
10/AUG DAY 10- Same as yesterday ^^^ Keeping motivated in the face of obstacles is hard.
11/AUG DAY 11- Rest day but staying active, voluntarily did 2 work outs just cause who am I 😹
12/AUG DAY 12- Returned to doing schedule as intended, my knee is still pretty weak but I'm still going!
13/AUG DAY 13- Done, sweaty, and feeling accomplished.
14/AUG DAY 14- Rest day, went for a walk.
15/AUG DAY 15- Hard to get into it but did it all, and went for a little walk 🙃
16/AUG DAY 16- Accomplished! But fml the arm circles and pulses etc KILL ME!
17/AUG DAY 17- Rest day, did an hours exercise to keep active, back on the clean eating buzz lol
18/AUG DAY 18- So sweaty today! 500 Ab rep was noticeably easier, I got to 80% before wanting a break!
19/AUG DAY 19- Done! 😓I got some not great news regarding my surgery today so it was hard to get motivated, but when you sorta have to force yourself into it you always feel better after!
20/AUG DAY 20- Omg I did all 500 ab reps 🙌 Eating clean makes such a difference to how my body looks.
21/AUG DAY 21- Rest day, gym and pool session.
22/AUG DAY 22- Felt relatively easy today! Also did gym session ✌️
23/AUG DAY 23- So hard today! shakey legs, my hips/thighs/bum are feeling it! Also noticing clean eating is a LOT easier this week, was gunna go for ice cream last night and I didn't even feel like it 😎
24/AUG DAY 24- Shit damn my arms are dead! Those work outs are not getting easier lol...
25/AUG DAY 25- Last rest day of the challenge! On the home stretch, off to the gym.
26/AUG DAY 26- I'd rather do up/down planks for a year than arm circles and pulses for 2 minutes lol
27/AUG DAY 27- Easy but good today! Feeling much better about myself compared to July!
28/AUG DAY 28!- FINISHED!! Feeling so accomplished, going to the gym before measuring my results, so excited for that, but also regardless of numbers and cms/inches I'm so stoked I did this challenge!!

RESULTS!!
1. Weight: 72kgs to 67kgs
2. I lost a total of 20.5cms around my body!!! 
3. The most impressive measurement losses are: 
      -Lower belly/ Love handles: 105cm to 97cms. That's -8cm!!
      -Booty: 110cm to 105cm. (-5cms)

*Taken from 15th of July to 28th August, on the day of the 'before' measurements I'd just started the 2 week shred challenge and on the day of the 'afters' I'd finished the 4 week Summer shred challenge.*",2020-07-31 21:43:35

Would the workout be just as effective if we did it in separate portions throughout the day, rather that just in a specific time limit of 25 minutes? 
For example, suppose I do the first 15 minutes of the workout now, and later, when I am done with my chores I jump into doing the remainder of the workout, would it be just as effective?

Day 1: I am disappointed in myself. I came into the beginning of the workout with a really positive mindset, but I lost that mindset by workout two. I kept dropping onto the ground and would be sitting there for a couple of seconds. This happened multiple times throughout the workout and I know I could have been better. I am frustrated with myself and I am going to make myself do better tomorrow. The only thing I’m a bit happy about is that I did do all the optional videos. So that’s day 1!✔️                                                                               Day 2: As I promised today was much better then yesterday. Once again I did the optional exercises. The first two videos were amazing, then I had to pause because me and my family went out to eat. Then we came back and I continued my workout, but I did a lot worse after that. But overall today was better then yesterday so I’m proud! Day two done!☑️          Day 3: So today was pretty good I did do the optional exercises, and I only fell down because my toe hurts. (I cut my toenail on my big toe way to short. Today was about the same as yesterday on a scale from one to ten. So I did good but not great. That’s day three!☑️ Day 4: today was fine. I did all of the optional exercises, and unless I say otherwise I will be doing the optional exercises for the rest of this program. I had to take a break because we were going out to eat and no one told me! But it was ok because I only had 1 not optional exercise left. So not super interesting today. But that’s day four!☑️                                                 Day 5: Rest Day!                                                           Day 6: Today was rough, I didn’t feel to proud of myself when I finished it because I was very slow and had to take lots of short breaks. I didn’t feel great today, and I think that effected my performance. So overall today was not very good, but that was day six!✔️                                                   Day 7: I didn’t have time to do it today, so instead I’m going to do it tomorrow. (Which would normally be a rest day). but that’s day seven!                                                                    Day 8: today was pretty good, obviously I did yesterday’s workout. I had to take one break after the first two workouts to eat dinner, but other then that I did pretty well. I did struggle a bit during the third video since I don’t have much arm strength. That’s day eight! ☑️",2020-07-20 00:52:41

Chest 36"" to 34 ""
I really noticed a difference in the look of my back.
Waist 39"" to 34.5""
Hips 43"" to 41""
Mostly, I did the low impact exercises, and worked my way up. Still, I finished doing about half the exercises low impact. 
My next goal is to complete your 2018 Summer Shred Challenge. I am starting it tomorrow.

"UgzpphstZ28vKLxFAgZ4AaABAg","UCAUPaqvTmziNkdDcstGyutA","Marina","Gonna comment here with my 4 weeks challenge progress. Results will be at the end 👇 

Before: 68,7kg
Right biceps: 33cm
Left biceps: 33cm
Right thigh: 54,5cm
Left thigh: 53,5cm
Bust: 94,5cm (already 3cm down after the 1st challenge)
Waist: 79cm
Hips: 95cm
Butt: 108cm
Obliques: 81,5cm

I did the 2 week shred challenge first, then took a week break. The challenge built my strength up, slimmed me down a little (no results on the scale, just on the overall look of my body). My waist, my arms, my love handles, my obliques, my hips... everything slimmed down. The most impressive: it took about 9cm off each of my thighs - I wasn't expecting that. 

My progress below 👇

Day 1 (06/07/2020) - ✅ did half the workout videos because I'm not feeling too well + arm exercises video (from another channel)

Day 2 (07/07/2020) - ✅ did all the exercises plus Back & Arm from yesterday

Day 3 (08/07/2020) - ✅ did all the exercises. I'm actually finding the ""full body workout"" video easier than the one on the 2 weeks challenge (that may be because I'm stronger now, though)

Day 4 (09/07/2020) - ✅ a c t i v e   r e s t : did some exercises - Tibetan Rites, one intense workout for arms (from another channel), Chloe's 10 Minutes Toned Arms and finished with a 12 Minutes Yoga for Brain Power (from Yoga With Adriene)

Extra day (10/07/2020) - ✅ I took another rest day - this time a total rest, not an active rest -  because I'm not feeling too well, I think I may be coming down with something. I didn't sleep very well, so it could also be it. My shoulders are sore from yesterday, so I may have gone a little overboard. I don't know if anyone is reading this, but I'll keep posting my progress anyway.

Day 5 (11/07/2020) - ✅ could do only 1/3 of the exercises because I didn't have enough time. My saturdays are always very full. I'll do all of them tomorrow, plus the optional from day 5

Day 6 (12/07/2020) - ✅ did all the exercises of today plus the ""upper body + arms"" from yesterday (the one I didnt't do yesterday). I also did the Tibetan Rites

Day 7 (13/07/2020) - ✅ a c t i v e   r e s t : did Tibetan Rites + 2 workouts for the arms (from 2 other channels) + 17 minutes yoga for the neck & shoulders (Yoga with Adriene)

Extra day (14/07/2020): ✅ again took a total rest day (I tend to do that since the 2 weeks shred, and that's totally okay)

Day 8 (15/07/2020) - ✅ did half the exercises today

Day 9 (16/07/2020) - ✅ did all the exercises (including the optional one) except for the abs one + Tibetan Rites

Day 10 (17/07/2020) - ✅ did Tibetan Rites + 2 of Chloe's vids for the day and finished with a 12 minutes yoga practice. Wasn't feeling it today, so I was gentle with myself.

Day 11 (18/07/2020) - ✅ a c t i v e   r e s t : saturday was so full I couldn't do anything

Day 12 (19/07/2020) -.✅ did all the exercises + Tibetan Rites

Day 13 (20/07/2020) - ✅ a c t i v e   r e s t : I moved the rest day on the schedule from tomorrow to today, so I'll workout tomorrow - did 20 minutes yoga (Yoga with Adriene)

Day 14 (21/07/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites + all the exercises of day 13 + 3 minutes of arm workout with a resistance band

Extra day (22/07/2020) - ✅ Barely slept today, so I took another day off

Day 15 (23/07/2020) - ✅ did Tibetan Rites + all the exercises on the schedule, but I did ""10 minutes toned arms"" instead of ""10 minutes lower abs""

Extra day (24/07/2020) - ✅ yup, took another rest day. Did 10 minutes of arm workout (from another channel)

Day 16 (25/07/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites + 15 minutes of arm workout (from another channel) + all the exercises from the schedule (including the 10 minutes toned arms). Well, today I can say I really worked my arms lol. Also did 3 minutes of high knees to  b u r n  some calories, and boy, were those minutes hard. I'll add minutes of high knees from now on

Day 17 (26/07/2020) - ✅ a c t i v e   r e s t : Tibetan Rites + 2 minutes high knees + 20 minutes yoga stretch (Yoga with Adriene) + 10 minutes nidra yoga

Day 18 (27/07/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites + 15 minutes arm workout (from another channel) + 2 out of the 3 vids of today (didn't feel like doing the abs one)

Extra day (28/07/2020) - ✅ I slimmed down considerably, but yesterday I saw I only lost 100 grams on the scale. I know it doesn't mean anything, I lost a lot of fat already, but... today I'm really not feelin' it. So I'll take another rest day.

So, I've been doing some research and found out those routines are actually targeting both fat loss and muscle gain, by doing ""strength/resistance training"" using our own body weight - plus cardio. So it actually means progress that I'm visibly way slimmer but didn't lose that much on the scale. It means I'm losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time, which is great for getting toned, not being flacid and having a more balanced body structure. So yay!

Extra day (29/07/2020) - ✅ took another extra rest day. I prioritized other things today, so I'll go back to the challenge again tomorrow

Day 19 (30/07/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites (increased repetitions, so I'm using them as warm up) + all the exercises on the schedule

Day 20 (31/07/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites + all exercises on the schedule except for the 2nd one for the abs

Day 21 (01/08/2020) - ✅ r e s t   d a y

Day 22 (02/08/2020) - ✅ did a 9 minutes arm workout (from another channel) + 1 of 2 videos (I skipped the abs one)

Extra day (03/08/2020) - ✅ busy day, couldn't do anything.

Day 23 (04/08/2020) - ✅ 10 minutes arm workout (from another channel) + all the exercises on the schedule (when I say that, I mean even the optional ones)

Extra day (05/08/2030) - ✅ yup, took another one

Day 24 (06/08/2020) - ✅ Tibetan Rites + all the exercises on the schedule (except for the abs one)

Day 25 (the entire month of august lol) - ✅ so, yup. Stopped in the midle because I wasn't feeling like doing anything, least of all exercises. Now I'm back to it.

I’ve been above 200 pounds for the past 5 years. I’ve tried everything to lose weight. Smoothie detox, starting jogging, taking longer walk everyday, some workout programs everything you can name I probably tried it. I’ve been between 205 and 210 pounds for a long time and I’ve been wanting to change the look of myself because I’m not confident in my body. Today I’m going to do day 4 of your challenge, I decided to weight myself before the workout and I literally started crying. I’m now 198 pounds. It’s just 2 pounds under 200 but that makes me sooooo happy!! I’ve never loved doing workouts because I’ve never seen a little bit of transformation on myself. But for real now I’m soooooooo motivated to continue doing this challenge to lose the extra weight I have!!

Day 1: I'm trying to workout outside to get more used to Texas heat (I'm in marching band and definitely need the conditioning). Got rained on at the beginning of the second video though XD. I couldn't do every exercise and had to skip the optional back video, but at least I'm starting!
Day 2: Late start today (like 5 hours late...), but I was able to do the entire 500 reps video without taking breaks during the exercises! The hourglass video was really tough and I felt super nauseous by the end, but I havent worked out in like a year, and this is the toughest stuff Ive ever done.
Day 3: Feeling pretty comfortable during the warmup now! My foot decided to die during the first video (an old injury flared up... yay lol) but I kept pushing! My upperbody is super weak so I had a bad time in the other two videos.

Height: 4'9"" (147 cm) 
Before measurements:
Waist: 25 inches
Belly: 31 inches
Glutes : 33.5 inches
Thighs: 19 inches
Calves: 12.5 inches

Day 1: ✔ The first day was challenging. Kept taking longer breaks . I barely managed to complete it o(╥﹏╥). Did all of the workouts in almost 2 hours. I hope it gets easier with time.  ≧﹏≦
Day 2: ✔ My muscles were sore from yesterday so it was hard to keep up but I did it. Took nearly one and half hour to complete all the workouts. ᕦ( ᐛ )ᕡ
Day 3: ✔ My arms are like jelly. I couldn't even lift them after the last workout. (ᗒᗩᗕ) 
Day 4: Active rest day. I walked for an hour and did some leg stretches. 😊
Day 5: ✔ It is getting easier to push through. Completed all of the workouts in almost two hours. I am definitely feeling stronger ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Day 6: ✔ Did all of the workouts in one and half hours. I can feel my stomach shrinking. It is not that big of a change but it is definitely better than nothing. Keep going. If I can do it then you can do it too. ٩( ᐛ )( ᐖ )۶
Day 7: Active rest day. Did 10 min low impact cardio and walked for 30 mins.
I took a day off because I wasn't feeling well. 
Day 8: ✔ My arms are sore. I did all of the workouts in almost two hours. I am starting to see a difference. My stomach is starting to tone up. (๑˃̵　ᴗ　˂̵)و
Day 9: ✔ Honestly this Hiit workout exhausts me to no end. It takes up all my energy. But still did it... And I got surprised today. I checked my height and found I grew 0.5 cm. I'm 4'10"" now (I'm 18 btw). I'm so happy.(≧∇≦)/
Day 10: ✔ Did all the workouts in the program + 28 day plank challenge. It took almost 2 hours but I'm feeling great. 😊
Day 11: Active rest day. I did the 28 day plank challenge and walked for an hour. 
Day 12: ✔ Today I was really feeling out of it. Maybe because I didn't get enough sleep (4 hours) but I didn't want to skip the day. So I did the low impact exercises for 2 of the workouts + 28 day Plank challenge. (っ◞‸◟c)
Day 13: ✔ Completed all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge in 2 hours. I still take longer breaks in between the exercises but it is getting better. 😊
Day 14: Active rest day. Did the 28 day plank challenge and an hour of walk.
Day 15: ✔ That 20 minutes hiit session was INTENSE. I can't believe I made it out alive. Did all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge. ᕕ( ཀ ʖ̯ ཀ)ᕗ
Day 16: ✔ Did all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge in 2 hours. Was feeling strong today. 💪('ω'💪)
Day 17: Active rest day. Did 15 min low impact cardio + 28 day plank challenge.
Day 18: ✔ Did all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge in two and a half hour. I was tired after the Hiit session. I think cardio is my weak area. o(ㄒoㄒ)
Day 19: ✔ Did all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge in one and a half hour. I had a cheat day today. I couldn't resist the pizza my family was having for dinner. 😅😭
Day 20: Active rest day. Did the 28 day plank challenge.
Day 21: ✔ Completed all of the workouts + 28 days plank challenge in almost an hour. I think my stamina has improved. (≡^∇^≡)
Day 22: ✔ I take back my words. My stamina has not improved. It took me two hours to complete all of the workouts + 28 days plank challenge. 😭
Day 23: ✔ I was bloated throughout the workouts because I got my periods today. Barely managed to finish the workouts in two hours. Thank god tomorrow is a rest day. ᕕ( ཀ ʖ̯ ཀ)ᕗ
Day 24: ✔ Did all of the workouts. My arms were sore but they have toned up. I can now do upto ten push ups. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Day 25: Active rest day. I walked around for an hour.
Day 26: ✔ I DID ALL OF THE WORKOUTS ON MY PERIODS. It was not easy at all. Took me almost 2 hours but I did it. 💪('ω'💪)
Day 27: ✔ Did all of the workouts + 28 day plank challenge in one and a half hour. My periods are nearly over but I'm still bloated. So I will post the results after some time. ✌
Day 28: ✔ FINALLY completed it. I gave it my all on the last day but it was still a bit hard. 😅
After measurement:
Waist: 24 inches
Belly: 29.5 inches
Glutes: 34 inches
Thighs: 18 inches
Calves: 12 inches
Other than that my abs have toned up quite a bit. They have defined lines. And my stamina has improved drastically. Overall I'm happy with the results. 
To all the people trying this challenge, do it. It will be hard in the beginning, but it will get better and you will feel so much better about yourself. This challenge is also a self esteem booster.

ALRIGHT I'VE COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. Changes I see in my body:
My body is much more toned in general, I feel more resistance in small daily activities (which is where I notice that I have become stronger). I do not consider having lost a lot of weight, I have no way to weigh myself (Although I try to eat healthily, I do not follow a strict diet and occasionally I eat fats and sugars). My stomach is much flatter and my neck is smoother, my arms are also stronger and my butt and legs look greaaaaaat, I see the change when I wear tight jeans that my hip dips have dicreased a lot. 
I'm really happy about the results and I won't stop excercicing because I want to keep my body fit since I used to struggle with being overweight during my childhood and adolescence. I'm tall and I have a curvy body and I want to be thinner but sometimes I think I just need to learn to love my body in its state.
To whoever is trying to complete Chloe's programs or getting a healthier life style trust in yourself and keep motivated because no one is gonna do it for you. You can do it no matter how much time it takes. ❤️
P.S.: I CAN GET UP FROM THE FLOOR USING ONLY MY LEGS, AAAAAAA.",2020-06-04 19:06:47

So I’m doing the summer shred and I’ll keep you guys updated (also hopefully this’ll stop me from just- well stopping) I do have exams in the next 1-2 weeks but I’ll try my best to do them and if I miss any I’ll do them when I can. 

Day 1: I decided to get cocky saying that I’d be able to do the warm up without breaking a sweat. By the third exercise I knew I was dead wrong but still did it. The workout sucked and there were some exercises I only did a few reps of. 

Day 2: I still did the warm up and the other exercises but I barely tried to push myself and felt really bad. I also stress ate at around midnight

Day3: I did the first day of the hourglass program to make up for everything I did yesterday and did the workouts for today. My upper body strength is non-existence so I was scared to do this but it turned out okay, not as bad as I thought. I still don’t see any progress but hey it’s still day 3

Day 4: rest day (I might do some light working out if I feel like it) later in the day: Y’all I just checked my weight and it says I gained a pound ;-; I feel bad now

Day 5: just checked how many calories I burned today and it’s at 300 (active) calories so, not too bad. I wanted to burn like 500 calories a day but maybe that’s hoping for too much? Also the exercises were way easier to do??? My heartbeat also leveled at 150 bpm by the 2nd video which is probably why I burned less than 100 calories per video after that. Finally found the HIIT section on the Apple Watch, an hour of working out is around 85 calories burned for me. Also I barely had to stop the videos today!

So I’m doing the summer shred and I’ll keep you guys updated (also hopefully this’ll stop me from just- well stopping) I do have exams in the next 1-2 weeks but I’ll try my best to do them and if I miss any I’ll do them when I can. 


Day 1: I decided to get cocky saying that I’d be able to do the warm up without breaking a sweat. By the third exercise I knew I was dead wrong but still did it. The workout sucked and there were some exercises I only did a few reps of. 

Day 2: I still did the warm up and the other exercises but I barely tried to push myself and felt really bad. I also stress ate at around midnight

Day3: I did the first day of the hourglass program to make up for everything I did yesterday and did the workouts for today. My upper body strength is non-existence so I was scared to do this but it turned out okay, not as bad as I thought. I still don’t see any progress but hey it’s still day 3

Day 4: rest day (I might do some light working out if I feel like it) later in the day: Y’all I just checked my weight and it says I gained a pound ;-; I feel bad now

Day 5: just checked how many calories I burned today and it’s at 300 (active) calories so, not too bad. I wanted to burn like 500 calories a day but maybe that’s hoping for too much? Also the exercises were way easier to do??? My heartbeat also leveled at 150 bpm by the 2nd video which is probably why I burned less than 100 calories per video after that. Finally found the HIIT section on the Apple Watch, an hour of working out is around 85 calories burned for me. Also, I barely had to stop the videos today!

Day 6: I got my period today and I have 3 exams tomorrow so I’m doing the workouts tomorrow (which is my rest day) see you tomorrow!

Day 7: I just finished all the exercises and added the fly tummy exercises today because I ate A LOT. Burned 524 calories today

Day 8: couldn’t track my calories and my cramps were really bad today so I didn't do the last workout

Day 9: everything went normal, I burned 372 active calories, super cool

Day 10: yay double digits! Did this at 12 am, we’re getting a treadmill so that’s cool. I burned 214 active calories today. Gained 2,4lbs/ 1.1kgs but I lost 0.2% of my body fat and gained 1.3lbs/ 0.6kgs of muscle from day 1 also my metabolism is 10kcals more meaning it’s higher/ faster. My bone mass is also 0.44lbs/ 0.2kg heavier??

Day 11: active rest day

Day 12: I’m pretty sure it was hard but it ended so quickly I barely remember. I am getting way more craving though so...

Day 13: the last one was a drag and took quite a long time but it was fine. I sweated a LOT today though

Day 14: rest day

Day 15: the last exercise was HELL. J died when u head her say “we’re done with the first set. Just three more to go.” 

Day 16,17,18,19,20,21: everything went by easily but I still hate any workouts that involve arms including ever high plank position workout",2020-05-28 13:12:17

Please like so I don't forget to update!

Age: Going 17
Height: 159 cm
Weight: 49 kg
Waist: 69 cm
Left upper thigh: 53.7 cm
Right upper thigh: 53.5 cm
Left upper arm: 29.5 cm
Right upper arm: 29.9 cm
Note: I measure it 1 week before the challenge and I also do some workout in the week, so maybe it's not very acurate.

Day 1: ✔️It was very hard for me, I paused for some times but I can finish all of the routine. I also do intermittent fasting starting from today!
Day 2: ✔️I did all the routine, but I paused the video some times, especially for the 500 reps abs video because I do HIIT before it so I was tired xD
Day 3: ✔️It's arm day today! My arm feel so sore and I take 5 minutes breaks between the videos. I think my arms are really weak compared to my legs... But I don't know I feel so happy today when I do the workout.
Day 4: ✔️It's active rest day today! Because it said ""active"" so I do some yoga and pilates to stretch my muscle and relieve the soreness caused yesterday's workout.
Day 5: ✔️Woah today is a bit hard I think, my arms feel so sore:"" But I do all the routine today!!
Day 6: ✔️Done! I paused the third video maybe 5 times... and also, today I ate so much calories.. so, i decided to do the third video tomorrow although tomorrow is a rest day!
Day 7: ✔️It's rest day todaayy! Yesterday I said that I'll do the yesterday's third vid, but I don't do it, I'm too lazy LOL.. But I do 10 mins jogging today!
Day 8: ✔️I did all the three videos! It's still hard but I do it all and I think it gets easier.
Day 9: ✔️I did all the exercises without any pause! But I took 10 mins rest between the 2nd and 3rd video.
Day 10: May 21, 17.10 GMT +7

Temporary result:
(I always measure it 3 times a day and write the average for each day here)
Weight: 48.2 kg (-0.8 kg)
Waist: 66.45 cm (-2.55 cm)
Left upper thigh: 52.28 cm (-1.42 cm)

"Ugwi1kn_-WCQK3-a-k54AaABAg","UCeL9kbd-hHm-TriaZkLOs9w","Riya Jobin","I've tried to complete some of Chloe Tings workout programs before, but I've always ended up quitting because of my lack of motivation. This time, I actually want to finish the program and lose the weight I gained in quarantine. I'll try to update daily. Wish me luck!
Day 1: I did the optional warm up and cool down, but I didn't manage to do the arm and back workout. The full body workout was really hard. I had to pause between exercises. I didn't do a good job on the an exercises because the full body workout had totally used up all my energy. I nearly decided against doing the cool down but it's actually really nice. Even if you are utterly exhausted I recommend you still do it.
Day 2: the ab workout was easier this time, because I hadn't already used up all of my energy doing the full body workout. The abs and butt workout, however, was excruciating. I've always really only focused on my abs, because I really hate my floppy belly, so I've never really done booty exercises before. Hopefully they won't be as painful by the end of the program. I also did the optional warm up and cool down.
Day 3: Today wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. After seeing the list of workouts I had to do, I thought I wouldn't be able to it all. As I mentioned earlier, I used to only really focus on my abs but the arm workouts weren't really that bad! I managed to do the 1st on without stopping at all. The second one was trickier and now my arms feel like jelly (in a good way!). The full body exercise just as hard as it was on the first day. I did the warm up and cool down as well. I'm looking forward to my rest day tomorrow :)
Day 4: Rest day.
Day: 5: I'm not too proud of myself today. I did the warm up and the cool down. I guess I wasn't really in the workout zone. I feel like I did worse than on day 1, which sucks. I woke up today with a stuffy nose, because I have allergies, which somehow got triggered while I was asleep. I spent the entire day avoiding the workouts and finding excuses to do it later. When I finally got my crap together and did it, I struggled a lot. It honestly felt like I had a cold while exercising (don't worry, I didn't actually have a cold, as of writing this, I feel fine). I couldn't bring myself to do the optional back workout. I skipped the last two exercises in the full body workout. Even the arm workout wasn't much fun. Usually, this is the time I would quit the program and eat my body weight in junk food, but I have decided to keep going. I'm going to start doing my workouts in the morning, so I can't weasel my way out of them. I really want to feel strong again, like I did on day 3. Wow, this edit turned out to be really long! BTW if you are reading this, are you supposed to do morning workouts on an empty stomach?
Day 6: Today was much better  than yesterday. I didn't do the Workout in the morning, I did it before lunch because I woke up really hungry. The full body workout was aeasier today. The ab workouts were a lot easier than they were on day 1. I have a much higher tolerance for different crunch variations and leg drop/raise variations. I sitill suck at planks though. I feel pretty great! I don't really have much else to say. I did the optional warm up and cool down as usual.
Day 7: Rest day.
Day 8: Totally killed the arm workouts! I finally managed to do the entire workout without stopping! I did the ab workout pretty well. I just can't do a side plank, I had to do the modification. The full body hiit was a really nice workout, too. I actually enjoy working out now! Even though I still feel like my limbs are all on fire, it's also somehow fun! I always feel really motivated to exercise when I wake up and feel really great afterwards. From now on, unless I say otherwise, I have done the warm up and cool down.
Day 9: I was really excited for today's Workout this morning when I realized: my period had come. Cue the dramatic dun dun dun sound effect and me internally screaming ""Noooooo!!!!!!!!"". 
""This is it."" I thought. ""I will have to quit the challenge."" All my hopes and dreams flushed down the toilet. But then. I realized…….. It didn't really hurt??? Yes, it hurt a little, I could feel it, but, it wasn't actually that bad??? Maybe this was salvageable??? Could I maybe I could still workout??? I still worked out. I had to do some of the modifications during the ab Workout, but it was fine. It actually hurts less now. Go figure. My legs and butt on the other Hand are now jelly, which is why I didn't do the optional butt workout.
Day 10: Today was a pretty good day. I really enjoyed the no jumping hiit workout. I did this in the morning and Chloe hadn't posted her lower ab workout yet, so I did her lower ab workout from her 28 day flat belly challenge. It was great! I really struggled during the back workout, because I just can't raise my legs while doing swimmers or similar exercises. The cool down was particularly relaxing today.
Day 11: Rest day.
Day 12: The full body workout was okay, the core and arm workouts were great, but what really hit me was the lower ab workout. Is it just me, or is it the hardest lower ab workout she has ever posted? I reallly struggled during that one and I had to modify many of the exercises. I am definitely going to add that ab workout to my workout schedule after i finish this programme. Other than that, I don't have much to say.
Day 13:  Today was an okay day. The cardio was fun but oh boy, were the other workouts tough. I didn't manage to finish either of them. I got rally close but not quite. The booty workout hurt SO much, it was insane. Is it supposed to feel like some one haspoured acid on your  hips? I guess I really need to train my booty more. I have no idea how some people do that workout WITH RESISTANCE BANDS. HOW???????  I am SO glad tomorrow  is a rest day.
Day 14: Rest day. To celebrate being half way through the programme, I made a low calorie cake!
Day 15: I was really out of the zone today. I slept horribly yesterday and it really impacted my performance today. The ab workout I could manage, but the hiit workout was too much. I ended up not finishing it. I'm pretty disappointed at myself, but I'll try to go to bed early today so I can be on top of my game tomorrow.  I have a very large and loud family, so going to bed early  doesn't equal sleep. I've actually had trouble falling asleep recently, because our walls are really thin. I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
Day 16: I woke up totally energized today! The quality of your sleep affects your workout performance. Go figure. I decided to go all out today to 
make up for yesterday's setback. The infamous lower ab workout was a TINY bit better today! Also, I can see improvements in my flexiblity from doing the cooldown stretches everyday. I didn't realize how much sleep I lacked till today.  I was technically getting 8 hours of sleep per day, but I guess I need more than that to properly function.
Day 17: I decided to do the 20 min full body hiit I didn't manage on day 15.  And Oh Lord, she doesn't call it ""intense"" for nothing. I had to modify 
about 70 % of the exercises. Lunge squat jump is the officially the second worst exercise ever. (Burpees will always hold 1st place) Also, who knew that an inverted plank is just as horrible as a regular plank? Not me when I started the workout! To be honest, it wasn't that bad I was just being dramatic. I wonder what gruesome exercises I must do tomorrow.
Day 18: Good Lord was today hard. I nearly died doing the hiit workout.Then came the booty workout, which was also pretty hellish but nothing can top that hiit workout. It took two minutes of me just sitting there to convince myself I needed to finish it after doing the first set. I never want to do that workout again. Sitting down hurts my poor buttcheeks. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, as it only consists of arm and ab workouts.
Day 19: Today was quite enjoyable.  The cardio workout was fun in comparison to the intense hiit workout. I had a blast doing the arm workout, the  ab workout was okay and the arm workout was strange because all the exercises were fun and easy except the ones where you had to lie on your back - I looked like a dying fish while I did those.
Day 20: Today was great! All the exercises were enjoyable. I didn't find enough time to incorporate the leg workout, though. 
Day 21: Rest day.
Day 22: Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to today, and I ended up missing today's workout. I, however, am not going to stop doing the programme, I'll just carry on with day 23 tomorrow.
Day 23: I wanted to make up for yesterday's missed so I decided I would really workout my booty and abs today. I was finally able to finish the lower ab workout without stopping or modifying exercises. I also managed to do the glute workout; I only stopped halfway for a small break. I figured it was better to do the mandatory workout properly and not do the optional one, than I was to do both ineffectively. My glutes happen to be my weakest muscles - my arms and abs are much stronger - so the workout was quite a challenge.

Day 24: Today was pretty good! Today was a fun day because there were only upper body workouts. I dont struggle through any of the arm workouts anymore and even the full body exercise was nice.",2020-05-12 16:29:24

Before you scroll past, whether you’re working out to get stronger, to loose weight or just because you’re bored, please remember that you should only be working out for yourself. Don’t work out to meet someone else’s standards or to impress someone etc, you should only be working out for yourself and yourself only. 
The only person who needs to approve of your body is you, not your friends, not your family, not your classmates/colleges and not your partner etc. only you.

But damn yours really are tough and challenging. So I decided I am gonna do this anyhow. I could go on till 10 mins only without a break, after that I had to take a break. And forgot I had to warmup too! Haha. And searching for a good warmup, and I stumble upon this! Hehe. Universe works in mysterious ways.

Day -5: Today’s workout was hard but not impossible. I took 2 minute breaks sometimes and worked on my breathing. And I’m not even kidding I notice a difference already. This motivates me soo much to keep going. Btw, cool down stretch was sooo nice and relaxing But anyways I don’t really feel much pain in my body.

Hi, my name is Rashida and I am 11 years old and I know, I am really young but I just wanted how thankful I am for all that you do to change people's lives. I actually only workout because I think it is good to stay healthy and I started to get serious about it but every time I just kept giving up but I also try to keep going. Anyways, when I started to do your workouts, I thought they were really good and I decided to do the 2 weeks shred and guess what, I SAW RESULTS. I was really happy. So what happened is one day my mom came across your workouts and she started doing them and I was like WOAH. so my mom convinced my dad to also do them and soon both of my parents were doing your workouts but then my aunt also wanted to try because she was also gaining weight. Now guess what, my whole family is doing your workouts. So I just wanted to say that thank you for not only helping me but also my family.
And also I love you so so so much. 💖",2020-05-09 20:30:31

I started following Chloe's channel and I don't know why I kind of got attracted towards it. Maybe all the encouragement she does before starting the workout. The vibe is really positive here and so are the comments. It feels like we all are a family. But unfortunately, due to a physical condition of mine, I couldn't continue her exercise for 1 month straight. Anyway, treating myself(the treatment is still going on though) I again started doing her exercise routine. I am confessing here that I lost 3kgs in 2 weeks. Of course with that, I am following intermittent fasting and drinking loads of water. It is also helping me a lot. I am much more energised than I was before. I was a lazy ass.

And everyone, don’t give up, because if you had the will to begin these workouts, then it means you have the courage to make things change and you’re in the right path !! Keep working and I hope you will make peace with yourself someday !

So I've been reading a lot of comments in your other videos about you making an app, I honestly (it's MY opinion, I want Chloe to see it) dont think you should do it. Why? Well. It takes you time AND money. To get to your website its not DIFFICULT. It's really easy and any people can get in it PLUS its FREE! The app you GUYSS, you have to download it and it will take space in your phone, the website will not! (Doesnt take you more than a minute to search her name in Google and get in her website.) And plus like I said before the website is free and easy to get in. The app will take Chloe time and money. It will take space from your phone when you download it. :)
So I think you shouldn't make an app Chloe :] it's just my opinion but idk what do y'all think? :]",2020-05-08 23:18:52

_Lots of Love from Philippines_

Guys, if you are struggling to exercise. DON'T GIVE UP! At first I feel like giving up and I always hide when doing Chloe Ting's workout. One time, my family saw me exercising I was embarrassed LIKE SUPPPERR DUPPER EMBARASSED but the good thing is they didn't mind me doing exercise they even joined me if they still have the energy(cuz they are working) and they helped me eating healthy. Like, buying healthy foods(fruits, vegetables, meat, etc.) And, soon I developed abs, muscles, hips, booty, etc. and until now I'm still doing it. I'm still struggling to exercise especially using those resistance and dumbbells, etc.
The good thing about doing this exercises/workouts I eat healthy. I mean healthy diet. And, it made me stonger and stronger. I was called fAt MANY TIMES but I didn't mind it.

Your workouts have literally changed my life. I started doing them inconsistently during my winter break in January and during lockdown, I've been more committed and I'm so happy with the results. It's not just about the look (although fr I've lost like 4 inches off my waist and I've never been happier to look at myself in the mirror), I also feel like I have more energy, I'm more focused, and I'm way more active. It's really all thanks to you and idk if you'll see this but you're literally one of the only good things to happen in 2020 so thank you so much <3",2020-05-08 13:38:04

My bloating is calming down, and I can really see my whole body tightening up. I have been training crossfit for about a year and a half and it really helped me so it is my main source of body movement. But the thing is that I am coming from an eating disorder background, and I had a really tough period from the end of 2019. till a now, and it really took a tool on my body, mind and life in general. So I decided to do this challenge, to try something new and different.. And for now I can tell it is doing wonders!!! Thank you Chloe!

I just want to say that recently I reached my weight goal from like 5 years ago and I didn't even try to do that. I just want you to know that the way is long and no matter how many times you fail it's important to keep going and trying and trying again. Also you should focus only on yourself. Do it for you, do it for your health, do it for better life and better mind for you! Never do it for anyone else) Good luck to you baby!",2021-01-27 07:30:34

You should wait a few hours after your last meal (best ist 5 to 6 hours) before you exercise. After exercising you should absolutely take a shower and then eat (though a quick ready snack directly after workout is ok).
As for what to eat: If you want to build muscles, poly-carbs and protein, magnesium, etc. Bananas are a great snack or dessert. Bread or potatoes, veggies are always ok. Meat or fish.
If you want primarily to loose weight, try to work out before dinner, then a low carb dish is best (fat burns best in protein, and the lack of carbs will burn your fat even faster). Lots of medium cooked veggies, with a third portion of meat or fish or cheese is great. Yoghurt is always good. Milk is also ok. Low fat nuts as hazelnuts are also good, as well as most kinds of beans.",2020-11-29 18:49:59

I started with her 10 mins Abs Workout to get Flat belly in 30 days, 10 mins Toned Arms Workout (no equipment) and 10 mins Standing Abs Workout to get Ripped Abs. 

Before the workouts, I also do this warm up routine then end it with her 10 mins full body cool down stretches for recovery and flexibilty. 

It's my 28th day doing these workouts and will finish on Tue, 10th Nov.

Then after you get used to these, you can change to a harder routine like the 2 weeks abs shred challenge. 

Hope this helps!",2020-11-08 09:00:11

I recommend you to keep pushing yourself even if you can't do the moves perfectly, don't get discouraged, b/c after a while you'll get stronger and be able to do it all properly. Don't expect to see changes so soon though, not until like two weeks, but I promise you'll be rewarded if you keep going:)
I think the most important thing about working out is persistance, you should make exercise a part of your life.

Just wanted to tell you that most girls have their first period between the ages 11 and 16, so you do not need to worry yet! Also, I've not heard of being overweight to be a cause of not getting your periods, being underweight or excessively sporting can be causes though. 

If there are other signs of your body becoming mature (breast growth or pubes) that shows your female hormones are working :) periods start quite a bit later.

Hope you're feeling ok and I hope to find motivation like yours to truly start working out! Every story is a little bit of extra motivation :)",2020-10-07 21:31:47

I was not well for past 4years , was in bed most of the time or at hospital. When I first started this warmup I was only able to do it for almost 2min and I felt after that I could breathe properly. After more 4days I was able to do it till 4min. Now I am doing it whole video (except for jumping exercise in the end).

They knew that I was doing workouts sometimes, but I never told them when I was doing them. When they came in while I was doing them I stopped and felt so embarrassed. Then maybe two months ago my mom said I should do them in our living room cause there’s much more space and a big tv so it would be more fun to workout. When I started working out in front of my family they started to realise that these workouts are actually really hard and they liked that I take care about myself. They actually were proud of me. Also as my family saw the progress I made, my mom started to join me while I work out. So now we are working out together and even my little brother sometimes joins us. It is way more fun to do these workouts with my mom and not being afraid of someone coming into my room. Also I feel much more confident as my parents love that I care about myself and treat my body right. I hope you can do that too. You don’t have to be ashamed about the fact that you are doing sports. Your family won’t judge you for that. Actually I think there is nothing that they can judge you for. You are just doing sports and that is something good for your soul and your body. So why should you be ashamed about that? Just try it! I am sure your parents will support you!",2020-07-25 11:27:46

The warm up and cool down are optional so you don’t have to do them but I recommend doing them anyways! (Also, some workout videos during certain days are optional as well but it’ll say on the website which are and which aren’t).
Hopefully that helps :)))",2020-06-01 09:04:23

I woke up this morning to check my results (bc I’m not usually bloated in the morning). I’ve lost 3 in. of stomach (33 to 30), 2 in of waist (29 to 27), 1 in of butt (38 to 37), 1 in of thighs (22 to 21) and not much difference in arms (like .5 give/take). My weight fluctuated between 119 and 122 (before I was 120). At the end it stayed on 121, which means I actually gained a pound instead of losing it :/. Honestly, I was both happy and disappointed bc what I really wanted to lose was butt/thigh and weight but I’m happy to see such major results in the stomach area.
