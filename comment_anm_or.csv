"Thanks Zak! Can you show what the more relaxed walk looks like (the one before the training walk) if a dog hasn't learned to stop pulling?  Is Inertia allowed to pull during this more relaxed walk? Does that negate the training walk? We sometimes actually do need to get somewhere with our dog Potet, but don't want to undo the little steps forward in our training.","Valentin Manz","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni62T3-DBvAV66tIYLW6ucvZx9eRML3ZtkmYHjz=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCksoCGqt1SA1YmcTD5jQ0uA","UCksoCGqt1SA1YmcTD5jQ0uA","0","0","2021-02-27T19:20:41Z","2021-02-27T19:20:41Z","Ugyz1igNkN8Evn9m3G94AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"What type of harness do you have on Inertia? My dogs are 20 steps behind Inertia (just got them 3 weeks ago), but they pull even using the Slip Rope Leads. We stop every time they pull (walking them separately) and wait till the come back to us releasing the tension themselves, then we reward with a treat. We've tried to use the Freedom harness and the Easy Walk harness and they pull uncontrollably - like they don't feel any resistance so they just want to pull. Advise on harnesses would be helpful. My dogs are 1) pit bull and 2) pit bull/basset hound mix (nose to the ground all of the time).","Kendra McDowell","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj9hImmaCU2vQy3S3kSBbJ0RHk4eYmeYuS9qFTqow=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOXk19Ibc0mRqSCmhqcJZA","UCAOXk19Ibc0mRqSCmhqcJZA","1","0","2021-02-16T16:09:36Z","2021-02-16T16:09:36Z","UgxaH1ZAEWQoFD__4MN4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"One good tip i got from the trainer we used is if they pull walk around them. Do a uturn in front of the dogs face and walk opposite direction. Important to cross in front of the dogs face. Its forces them to look at you and follow you.

Do the uturn in front of them and then make them sit. When they sit continue. This forces them to see you and follow and it teaches that you lead when you dont move till the sit. Treats when they are staying by your side and look up at you. And treats when they sit.","Praise LordCthulhu","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng-kkNc1wfr-zkUixOlP2-wLQscvnS92kuoWvMKBg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5M-qUjd3jYKq55eUdVWoDw","UC5M-qUjd3jYKq55eUdVWoDw","0","0","2021-01-25T08:33:47Z","2021-01-25T08:33:47Z","UgxIVeA_97VVXvRWONF4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"I'm a new dog owner and I have a 3mo old black lab who is a sweet boy, but he gets really riled up and he's a constant biter. When we go for walks he wants to out everything he isn't supposed to eat in his mouth which I have to then take it out of his mouth, which isn't always easy. During the walk he wants to always go chew on the trees or whatever and he will dig in and not pay attention to me. When were close to home he gets HYPER excited and tries to sprint, lunge, and then bite me. Jump up and bite my hands, bite at my feet, pull at my pants and just get aggressive. 

Have any of you experienced the same thing as I have? How do I try to fix this? When he's riled up he gets aggressive with his bites and I can't get him to calm down without putting him in his bed and leaving him alone for 10-15 minutes. Its very frustrating and I feel very lost sometimes.

She chases small animals to play but doesn't listen unless constant treats are being given. I just want to be able to walk my dog or take her for a run but its become impossible. She is always distracted and excited. anyone know of anyone who has actually done videos with a dog they just met that has very little training because the dog refuses to accept it.

He has a lot of energy so I need to go on walks quite often or go on a bike ride with him, he pulls on the leash a lot so that is why I want to try out this video. But if I am done with one training session, he will not have reveived nearly enough exercise, so I will have to take him out for a proper walk where he would then of course pull on the leash since he has only had one training session for example. If the training session is done, and I go for a long walk, should I continue this training or can he then pull on the leash since the training session is over?

"Normally my son is the one that takes our male dog, Smokey, out for after dinner walks daily. Today,I decided to go with them & I learned that at every mailbox, he had to pee on the post (like he's marking his territory)...and when he wasnt peeing, his nose is to the ground sniffing constantly while pulling on the leash. It didnt matter if he was on the pavement, gravel or grass his nose never stopped sniffing & was told he sniffs & pulls the leash the entire time every single day. My son only takes him for walks on our street so its not a new area. He's a Dachshund, Blue Healer & Chihuahua mix. Any advice? FYI: when I take him outside to go potty on our property, he doesnt pull on the leash but he does constantly sniff. Only time he isnt sniffing, is when he is peeing.","Ali","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjtK9lTvl1nFEWlCZIs7h60nQLXfVuAIxQlXDRv=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRdJjSMZ7MazXsXbkQR-zew","UCRdJjSMZ7MazXsXbkQR-zew","0","0","2020-09-26T05:26:15Z","2020-09-26T05:36:55Z","UgwlsRtRnWydOvJoYvd4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"I know you say its a bit embarrassing to you that you re a dog trainer and inertia is the way she is, but honestly its far more helpful for me watching to see a dog like her and learn how she is being taught.  I'm getting an Aussie puppy in a month when he is ready to come home and seeing you with her rather than a well behaved dog gives confidence.  I've had dogs with what I call an unruly personality and I understand the training process so much better seeing the fails with Inertia than other training videos.  So thank you for continuing to share how to train this type of personality instead of just an obedient dog.

"again, with very little experience my 3.5 month old puppy is more obedient and more focused than Zak's dog! his method of being so soft with dogs doesn't appear to be effective in my own opinion as his dog barely acknowledges him. The same with the dog nipping and with dogs jumping up and down. I never had success with this very soft approach and not all dogs are the same but being firm and strict with dogs is not a bad thing, Dogs do well with a strong leader and not someone who is begging them to do something...Cesar Milan's style is a bit more my method and I've had wayyyy more success being firm and not begging my dog to do the smallest of task but instead let them know that they have to do it","Joey Jojo","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnia2e8xTMmHuColB756HQMJEM412A_lIE1QJIuznak=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoPBsGCrt72sDZ4MaloABZA","UCoPBsGCrt72sDZ4MaloABZA","0","0","2020-07-30T16:26:47Z","2020-07-30T16:30:13Z","UgxNP4HSOCZMf6OX5sR4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Hi dog lover,


No matter what your dog‚Äôs problem behavior is‚Ä¶



Be it jumping, peeing inappropriately, aggression, pulling on the leash‚Ä¶or whatever‚Ä¶



There is ONE SOLUTION that can help STOP this problem now



The sad fact is‚Ä¶



Most Dog trainers miss this solution entirely.



They give you cookie cutting training programs.



They use outdated and ‚Äòmean‚Äô dominance techniques.



Or worse yet‚Ä¶



They have no qualifications and are complete phonies.



So what‚Äôs the answer to stopping your Dog‚Äôs behavior problems?



In 4 simple words‚Ä¶



Discovering your dog‚Äôs hidden intelligence.



Let me explain‚Ä¶



In my 10 years as a certified trainer‚Ä¶there‚Äôs ONE BIG LESSON I have learned.



More intelligent dogs are better behaved.



A More intelligent dog takes commands easier



‚Ä¶and understands what you need from them.



The good news is‚Ä¶



No matter how clever you think your dog is.



You can >>>unlock their hidden intelligence quickly and easily.

I‚Äôll explain everything on this page.



Don‚Äôt waste a second longer coping with problem behaviors you don‚Äôt need to be dealing with.

"You can tell Zak loves dogs and has absolutely good intentions. But positive only approaches like this are not fair on dogs. Dogs need positive rewards but also corrections:a balanced approach. There are so many better trainers out there using a balanced approach  This positive only approach is dangerous because people will try it and when it doesn't work on some  dogs they are labelled as bad or aggressive and owners give up on them. Dogs need rewards AND corrections:a balance approach. Seek out Michael Ellis and Robert Cabral .Two of the very  best.","wes trev","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniazFHnedt4D_23oCAM92AK9QTpGAVaRWa_aQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIjK0ynq0-unHfkdcd64vLA","UCIjK0ynq0-unHfkdcd64vLA","0","0","2020-06-16T17:37:22Z","2020-06-16T17:42:12Z","Ugwsztc_qB-OfRFnMQl4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

In his later work, he has reversed his theory on ""alpha/dominance"" , and has asked publishers to stop printing his previous findings. So please, do your own research. Cesar loves dogs, but his methods set back dog training 30 years.

"Thank you, I am teaching my 9 weeks old puppy to walk on leash, so far it was not so easy. Maybe that will help me. By the way, my dog is much smaller, she only weights around a kilo and a half and there are a lot of bushes and high grass around my house. So I prefer her to walk on the leash because once she enters those bushes and high grass it's extremely difficult to spot that little dog, she basically vanishes.","Perrito Brodersen","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhfoVnFKtyoZbJCdw0UY8-Gl7AVRTjAb_bt=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiup6QXSNGvB-l6IpwBGLWQ","UCiup6QXSNGvB-l6IpwBGLWQ","0","0","2020-05-30T15:40:59Z","2020-05-30T15:40:59Z","UgwuKo7UKIH9qs10f854AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"We rescued a year and a half to two year old Great Pyrenees a few months back and training him has been challenging. In the past we've had much more people pleasing dogs like Golden Retreivers, & Bichon Frises who were extremely easy to train. I just tried a few of the techniques I saw here, and as soon as I opened the front door, he stopped being receptive to treats. He wasn't interested in them, and even if he gave me his attention, and I offered him one, he wouldn't eat it. He followed me well in the house, but that open door was a whole new level for him. Even after I shut the door, and brought him back away from the entryway, he still wasn't receptive to treats anymore. He'd either look at me, or the door, but not eat. I thought maybe he might just not be hungry, but as I was putting away the leash, and taking off my shoes, he sniffed the treats out in my pocket and wanted one. Because I was curious myself, I let him have one and he ate it up just fine.

What now??? The best I can figure is to try this again tomorrow and hope for better results. I'm not a dog trainer, and I've never had such a stubborn dog before, so I'm still trying to figure all this out. I know Pyrenees are supposed to be stubborn, but man, that was an understatement. We'll take him for a walk, and as long as we're some place new, he'll walk pretty nicely. He doesn't pull much at all, and stays with me fairly well, but when we go to a place he knows well, like the trail around the local lake or around the neighborhood, he'll pull every which way, or alternatively, lay down and refuse to move at all for several minutes at a time.

He's a sweet dog, as I type sitting at my desk in front of my computer, he's got his giant chin resting on my elbow looking at me wondering why I'm not giving him more attention and/or maybe treats, but I'm starting to get frustrated with his stubbornness. After the 3 months since we got him, he's only marginally improved on the leash, and I'd like to be able to take him out without a couple ten minute breaks in the middle of our walks.

Any constructive advice would be welcome.","RicoLen1","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjErfOHewIgViGXDO-Ijl589Z8EQpGbfKO6KxoW=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgAmzgU-R9eo9yNY79LYrHA","UCgAmzgU-R9eo9yNY79LYrHA","0","0","2020-05-18T21:28:50Z","2020-05-18T21:28:50Z","Ugz9Mb3DQGUMzAIQhBZ4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Homie she was struggling so hard because when she was preforming one command like ""take a bow"" but does a lay down you accept a lay down over the correct behavior also throw in ""stand"" almost immediately after she got confused and was like wtf do you want which made her do the ""play dead"" behavior . I know that it gets very frustrating when walk training andthe dog is not listening or is fatigued I get it but really though use less words . Also in my opinion your dog should always be walking the side traffic is not and use commands like ""uh-uh"" or ""hey-hey"" or ""slow down"" to correct behaviors instead of saying the dog's name a bit aggressively so she doesn't relate her name to bad behavior or treats because I want to not have to bring treats everywhere and everytimei go for a walk lol you even said u didn't wanna use alot when outside then switched to  rewarding  . I just wanna throw this in , when i start to walk out my front door with my dog  I do the same thing have her wait in the door way ,step out sit then I close the door and when I take that first step and she pulls my arm off I say ""hey-hey"" .. then turn around go right back in side take her harness and leash off, put it up  go sit down making he dog think the walk is done for 5 min later say do u wanna go on a walk and put harness and leash back on then repeat the steps close the door and take that first again and if she pulls again for one second I turn right back around and do it again . Took about 5 redos till she realized she's not the leader . When they try to get away with leading because of a dog , cat , human or poop I make em ""wait"" ( stop walking sit and stay ) back track a few step the continue and when they following again I give heavy verbal praise no treats . Only using treats and multiple different treats like kibble dog treats and lunch meat  when doing off leash recall training or correcting dangerous behavior like chasing something across the st so if they hear me say their name aggressively along with a  command like COME  or HEEL or LEAVE IT they won't think oh shit I'm in trouble they will think tuuurkeyyyü§§ and that's when I would use a high value treat likelunch meat  and kibble for things like jus recall when playing fetch and dog biscuits for if she loses interest in the kibble . Also a dog needs no more than three feet of leash.","Lamb Chop","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhL2fJGZFOn7xKOVBXY_wWVGWhGjfC9Bx2FXg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKVVkPgxR6kB6nuAy44k4NA","UCKVVkPgxR6kB6nuAy44k4NA","0","1","2020-05-03T18:00:54Z","2020-05-03T18:00:54Z","UgycUIiPl0zqB7GWKE94AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"So interesting to see the 'live' training of a Border Collie, and encouraging to see that Inertia started just as pulley and distractible as Bonnie (14 weeks). For some reason it has never occurred to me to walk her as far as the doorstep, or to just stop and hang out if she loses focus. I love the 'retreating just to get some good behaviour' - but there's no way I am more exciting than dog poo!  What I wonder with the lead training is: when do you start withdrawing the treats? I think Bonnie has got a bit dependent on them, and tends to give me attention, take the treat, then dash off. Will sometimes not giving a treat break that habit?","PermaHeretic","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniH9X66ldrpYj-eZ-mF-SvklWYFQjO1ns03dg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4acFrER0cqVJsGAsNyywA","UCo4acFrER0cqVJsGAsNyywA","0","0","2020-04-19T20:20:03Z","2020-04-19T20:20:03Z","UgwoTgTSSr2HVFj8Tlx4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Hey Zak! Thanks for making these videos!From this video I have already learned I need to slow down my process into more mini modules of learning then I am¬†

 I have a few questions :

I have always been told when you train a dog commands, to Give the command ONCE and show the behavior desired after that to let the dog know the FIRST time you say the command is when you want it done. have also been from the school of thought that using a Rolled leather collar is best. That being said, with the method you have used, how does the dog learn to do the command  when asked vrs whenever they feel they are ready to do it. Training methods and systems have changed since I last worked with a dog and I now have a 12 week old pup I am starting to work with. I am leaning towards the Gentle Lead Collar for him he is a rescue puppy .

"Inertia is a sweetheart, and you are a very good trainer. But I WILL say, a lot of dogs do not respond to this ""whenever you're ready"" approach. As the ""leader of the pack"" for a lot of dogs you have to reinforce that you ARE the alpha, and they need to trust you. For my dog, I had to be a lot harsher. She's a GSD, and is VERY wolfish. To get her to respect me, I had to have a harder hand. If she didn't do what I asked, and I knew she KNEW what I wanted, I would let her know that wasn't acceptable. A ""I don't want to listen to you right now "" is not okay. And to answer peoples questions, no I do not hit my dog. I am just very very firm. For a lot of dogs, this gentle, treat led approach is just not enough. You also do NOT want to let your dog start relying on treats, because they will start to get vindictive if they don't receive it. The basics of dog training is you want to make life as easy and secure for THEM as you can. They should listen to you REGARDLESS of treats, because if God forbid something happens to you, they need to be as adoptable as possible. And they also need to have faith in you as the alpha. If they know you"" don't take no crap "" then they will feel safe in unsure circumstances.","Kesia Leonardo","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjpsvnbMqGAZ0GllkxH7Kn8ZC3_gpD6yaYRvGVw2w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPN9rpUUEdD1DK6EPf-hBAg","UCPN9rpUUEdD1DK6EPf-hBAg","0","1","2020-04-09T00:11:52Z","2020-04-09T00:11:52Z","Ugw5lqTzpz7mD7fSGXN4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Hello fellow dog lovers.  I feel obliged to share insight that I had to learn the hard way when I first learned how to train my dogs.


Disclaimer:  I know many people will get angry by the comments that will follow because many viewers are probably subscribers to this gentleman in the video.  But like I said, I have to save people all the painstaking hours I wasted learning to train my dogs.


So here is what I learned.  There are two camps of dog training: 1.  positive only 2. balanced.  This channel is an example of positive only.  The philosophy behind this method of training is that you do not give the dog consequences ever.  This sounds nice, BUT DOES NOT WORK.  I promise you, I wasted like 2 years.  Balanced dog trainers use rewards for good behavior and corrections for unwanted behavior.  Works every time.  Less confusing for the dog.  Most balanced trainers do not respect trainers such as this person for a couple reasons.  First, when you truly think about it philosophically, there is no such thing as 'positive only.'  As soon as you put a leash on a dog, you are giving the dog a consequence simply by putting a leash on it.  So, the balanced training camp believes these types of trainers are dishonest in their marketing.  Second, balanced trainers know this type of training does not work.  


I am not a dog trainer.  I have no affiliation with the dog training market and make no money from any of this.  I am simply a normal pet dog owner who spent several years learning this DOES NOT WORK.  Good training channels:  Solid K9 Training, The Good Dog, Robert Cabral, etc.  Essentially, anyone who falls into the 'balanced training' camp, if they are competent, is better than this philosophy.  I learned how to train my dogs for free to a very high level from the channels I listed above.  Your welcome.","Joe Gasparro","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniBLSpu_kGMxljSkPWfrf5SyGL6n4adXOhAYA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4bCv0Agf0rPvAV2FStmOyw","UC4bCv0Agf0rPvAV2FStmOyw","0","1","2020-03-27T02:56:04Z","2020-03-27T02:56:04Z","UgzVCdk_BHkeWFnuTyR4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"I love a lot of your Methods Zak George!
But I got to say I don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt have her better trained to walk on a loose leash without pulling?
Since you‚Äôve had her since she was a little puppy eight weeks old, I‚Äôve had dogs to where they were walking on a loose leash good within a week even as an eight week old puppy.
But my methods are different than yours as long as they‚Äôre on leash they need to not pull, that‚Äôs pretty much their job when they‚Äôre on leash for me.
And I don‚Äôt use a harness just a regular collar or a Martingale collar depending on if it‚Äôs a scared puppy. If they‚Äôre a small dog I do use a harness.
And also I find it more exciting and fun for the puppy if they‚Äôre not tired, when I go to train them and then I let them off leash to play and have fun and wear themselves out, after training as a extra big reward!
My first puppy when I was a teenager  I was healing my puppy off leash at three months old, in a distracting 
area in the park, and to the park he would heal on a loose leash.
And I want them to be focused on me as well with the watch me.

You could demonstrate how beautiful a yard free of chemicals and full of wild flowers and wild plants like milk weed can look.","kiran wingelaar","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni9MlcpFR4JLF8dLJR0oFOIPkRwWncMddjdASdu=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_AZGKlpDhSEVLeJRNAxvg","UCg_AZGKlpDhSEVLeJRNAxvg","0","0","2020-03-10T18:45:19Z","2020-03-10T18:45:19Z","Ugxjl_BnLa55YXRtgmd4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"EVERYONE I HAVE AN ANOUNCEMENT. The best way to stop pulling in dogs is to buy a herm sprenger prong collar that will train your dog in minutes and doesn't hurt your dog and is designed to be the safest collar out their yes safer than a harness. And is the best tool to communicate to your dog please no dog owner wants to put up with the bullshit that is training your dog for 5 years bro the positive shit doesn't work unless to teach commands like high 5 and so forth please watch this youtuber called solid k9 training which will teach just about everything about it just remember if you are thinking oh this can hurt my dog I am here to say that it can if used wrong but anything can be harmful if used the wrong way like a car a gun or even dog treats yes if you stuff your dog with treats everyday listening to this ideot you guys call a dog trainer you can make your dog obese which can later cause heart disease and cancer so please watch solid k9 training YouTube channel and you will understand that it is a amazing tool. And yes I know it looks like a torture device but I promise you it's not all I'm asking is for you guys to check him out because I'm tired of people putting down their dogs for things that can be fixed within minutes","Ivan Alfonso","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni7pw1EqL6zpI8zQ9T2kHcHOZYGGMu2ZXZv-39Ezw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClShO4EzMLjBHvXkxzkyQ5Q","UClShO4EzMLjBHvXkxzkyQ5Q","1","0","2020-02-25T21:27:37Z","2020-02-25T21:27:37Z","Ugwb5DvSKswZ8jKmQMd4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"I have a lab/hound mix. She's very sweet and learning quickly but leash walking is a major struggle. I like to run sometimes so I'm trying to teach the difference between run and walk. I can get her to sit when a car is coming and she will sit if I stop walking and wait till I start again but then its pulling or running. No walking until she's tired. She's almost 14 weeks.

"What I learned:
Inertia knows  that if she is persistently producing undesirable behavior, Zak will cave.  She then gets the self reinforcing positive stimulus of huffing  poop scent, while simultaneously getting food rewards.  Meanwhile Zak's ego leads him to believe he is helping someone , whille training his puppy.

"This video is exceptional!  You are an amazing trainer and I love your positive association reward based training techniques!  I love this video demonstrating real life challenges of walking a dog outside in an actual busy  neighborhood! Thank you so much for sharing your videos on YouTube!  Our dog is a rescue from S. Korea DMt so she is very fearful and gets extremely uncomfortable leaving our yard. She gets spooked by overstimulation and drags me home in a total panic. I didn't want to keep forcing her because it sets her back so I avoided it but this inspires me to keep trying, even just a little at a time and work in small sections. I need to limit her exposure and allow her to build her confidence. Thank you again!  I've had 3 behavioral trainers and our girl is extremely food motivated but not when distracted and scared by things outside.  After watching this I'm ready to try again and may ask a few neighbors to be outside to be ready with a few treats so she has something exciting to look forward to as we make our way down the street! ‚ô•Ô∏èüêï thanks again! This video is one of the best I've seen!","Carrie Gibson","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngbXEmkYCPVAEyhgssd41YFlZTEwGoQ2x2laA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHXf78ki2w1gyLc7IY_o3Ow","UCHXf78ki2w1gyLc7IY_o3Ow","0","2","2020-01-12T00:52:00Z","2020-01-12T00:52:00Z","UgwJEa51HgWaifo8SxV4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"
"Hi Zak! My puppy is 12 months old and he is used to being on a leash. Unfortunately after I tried to let him go oof he runs away every time. I think it‚Äôs my mistake because when he was smaller I wouldn‚Äôt let him explore as much. At first I was thinking it‚Äôs just his adolescence stage but now that he‚Äôs getting neutered, I‚Äôm scared he will keep on going out like he is. Now I‚Äôm scared to let him go off on his own. For example, once I let him go out on his own and he ran away with a random stranger, and also one time, he ran into an active street.

"""I could never trust my dog off the leash, he would run away and I would never see him again"" is probably the saddest thing a dog owner could ever say. Your dog wouldn't STAY with you even out of loyalty? ""No he's silly"". YOU'RE SILLY, KAREN and your dog is a pot plant to you.

I walk my dog off the leash everywhere and just use voice commands. Today as he was bouncing along beside me he found a new friend on the street, a hobbling grey old mutt of a similar breed. I remarked to the owners on the breed, and they said ""Yes but our girl is a fair bit old than yours, she's 13. How old's your pup?"" And I looked at them and I said, ""He just turned 13"". All I could think is that most dogs live a very slow, waddling lifestyle, living inside, and then walking on leashes, and get neither enough exercise or the training to build a reliable dog, or the freedom to explore and be a real animal. Most dogs live pretty average, un-stimulated lives compared to my little rescue genius.","Glenn Davey","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhzq0Yw-s7fF6Gcrl2EpnxNX1kLQ4mzJxnkqpy5W2Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3LKlaEx2Q3NKghjze5JYA","UCy3LKlaEx2Q3NKghjze5JYA","0","1","2020-01-11T13:07:30Z","2020-01-11T13:12:39Z","UgxwQVtfRmU6BITnr794AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Hello, I have the opposite issue with leash training. Once we put the leash on our dog, she does not want to move at all. Is anyone facing the same situation? Any advice would be appreciated.
Background info: We rescued the puppy in December. She is around 4 to 5 months old. She is doing great at Leave it, look at me, we are progressing on sit this week. Luckily, we have a big yard so I take her out for potty training without a leash which is not ideal as she is usually way too far from me when she is peeing or pooping and I have to run to her to give her a treat or call her to give her a treat. If she was on leash, it would have been  better. However each time I put the leash on her, she just would not move an inch. I tried just putting the leash on her and leaving it on her during the day so that she can get used to it but it is not working.

"Yikes, ""you NEED to have their food automatically shipped to you"" is a really disingenuous way to open an ad segment. Really disrupts my trust in whatever content follows, even though I know you're a great trainer. I've liked your videos before and I'm glad you have a sponsor, but please reconsider your wording and don't use your influence to push something as a necessity that is factually NOT a necessity.

"My Bull Terrier Bella is doing so much better on walks. She's walking by my side now more often than not and if she starts to pull, I give her a little leash nudge and she gets back on track. The other day she was excited in a different area so I tried going the opposite direction and she stopped pulling and resumed a relaxed walk. She does better once she acclimates to the area or if she's tired. Last night we walked through Petsmart and she did great. If she sees a dog, she gets excited so we stop and wait or go further away and this helps as well.

"Hi Zak, I love your videos! I recently got a puppy and I've been trying to leash train how you show in your videos but the problem I'm having is that my dog LOVES treats so much that once he realizes I have them with me all he can focus on is trying to get in my pocket! Then it's even harder to control him. Do you have any advice for this? Or does that just mean that he won't pay good enough attention to me yet? thanks!!","Lindsay Carpenter","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjdG2DOLL0L_d5kZx3t1aWzw353IfZQTG9lZQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4oLrBv8KR0Crj7vurY7Sw","UCV4oLrBv8KR0Crj7vurY7Sw","2","0","2020-01-05T18:52:16Z","2020-01-05T18:52:16Z","UgwJssAlKnqGA1Anurp4AaABAg",NA,"kTxL82Dp-XM"

"All due respect to Zak, but to anyone reading this please do not train your dog how to walk on a loose lead using a harness.
You're not helping your dog at all by having pressure being pulled across the sternum/clavicle/chest and under their elbows. You are still at risk for choking them because their trachea is still getting crushed.
You use a harness when you wanted your dog to be able to have full range and power of their front legs (where they have all their strength). Ya know, so they can grip their paws into the ground and *pull their sled/cart*.

"Zak is a joke considering hes supposed to be a dog trainer LOL, what a load of bull crap hes teaching people. especially if you have a high drive, big powerful breed then his techniques are useless especially using a harness it's well know that harnesses encouraging pulling and Zak should know this. It's not hard training leash pressure and if he had done this when his dog was young he wouldn't still be working on this issue. If you people want proper training try watching Robert Cabral or Larry Krohn on you tube and then you will realise Zaks a freaking joke. I bet his dogs gonna be the same bad mannered dog in a years time. Prove me wrong Zak and make a video showing off leash recall, sit, down stay etc. I have a 6 month old Malinous who can do all the above and more and I dont use ecollar to train these behaviours.

"Raquel Hatake  Hi Raquel. Practice at home walking her either inside or in your yard /garden if you have one. When she walks just a little bit tell her ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and give her a treat. Each time she walks a couple of steps ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and treat. When she does a couple of steps reliably, increase the number of steps before ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and treat.  Keep it going.  Don‚Äôt train for longer than 5 - 8 minutes to prevent boredom and finish with a game of tug or ball throwing. Eventually, she will walk longer and you can treat less but, less treats means more praise, so praise her often and treat occasionally. When she is getting the message, take her outside and do the same. You may have to go back a couple of steps as outside the home is a different environment.  Remember the 3 Ps with dog training. Patience, persistence and positivity.  Love from the UK.","Tina Jefferies","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjD4z0zn95Ta6fuJAuQawqPe0cwrAfL9i2a6Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6mW2ofJXnx3XO1AfhPebg","UCt6mW2ofJXnx3XO1AfhPebg","0","0","2020-07-10T18:10:59Z","2020-07-10T18:10:59Z","UgxpnHWfMbea1ImcvQB4AaABAg.9AlV2C9moM_9AweeLCQDSV","UgxpnHWfMbea1ImcvQB4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

Try to get your dog's energy out as much as possible before walks such as fetch. You'll still want to watch videos or, possibly even better, get a trainer, but you want to start out inside practicing using leash, then to backyard or driveway, then progress to walks.

"@Grace Ramos - I wouldn't use a prong collar but a good harness with two lead attachments - one for the front so you can bring their front end towards you - and a slight 'martingale' action is useful. 
Ultimately though, as one of the trainers at the dog training school I go to says, every time you carry on walking with your dog puling hard out ahead  of you - leading the way - you are basically saying ""that's fine - you carry on - I'm fine with you pulling"". Zak's approach is time consuming but it is the only one that really works.","honeychurchgipsy6","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnibZ6xZkNGMSfXKkr-4vk7qeMyiOtFVbsIIUlql=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqGXuItBgWaujL_2TE3zQ","UCXuqGXuItBgWaujL_2TE3zQ","0","4","2020-12-27T18:09:24Z","2020-12-27T18:09:24Z","Ugxx7d3153xFLaYT_qJ4AaABAg.99w7hrpezST9HmObRHGuJH","Ugxx7d3153xFLaYT_qJ4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

There is no need to teach ‚Äòboundaries‚Äô using painful punishments. Dogs learn better through totally positive reinforcement.  Boundaries can be taught without cruelty.  I taught my foster Staffordshire not to pee & poo in my back garden Within 10 days. That‚Äôs a huge boundary because he likes to pee & poo on grass! He gets plenty of toilet opportunities elsewhere.

"@TinyFlame  Just for real life example, my 10 and a half week old lab has learned the basics, Sit, Stay, Off, Leave It, Go To Your Bed, and are already seeing a maybe 10% potty training accidents. Now I don't correct for potty training with the Command Collar, just put her outside if she has an accident then maybe 10 or 15 sec later depending on if she is waiting patiently or walking around. ( I am letting her walk around to encourage more independence as her separation issue is pretty hard on her right now).

Not a single treat has been used to encourage the basic commands, 

Now for the separation, a treat or 2 to encourage the happiness when alone is the most we have done their. And her treat is peanut butter or a softened bone in her kennel before we leave.

She gets play sessions and praise and has shown no cowardice or saddened eyes when training, understanding what should be done opens the world to go on walks and socialization with people, not other dogs yet besides our Dane, because she does not have her second round of vaccinations, 

And a ""Good Girl"" perks her up lol

This type of training works im telling you, and done properly makes the dog even happier and able to do more.","HappyTrails 1","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng4CQxCHKBTdIplriEVPdVp5k9uMpqvCLVusF_B6Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbli6inyfb5GCDRhTc02XmA","UCbli6inyfb5GCDRhTc02XmA","0","1","2021-01-11T16:49:16Z","2021-01-11T16:49:16Z","Ugzv18EGbUQRhpkg46N4AaABAg.96tKrGfp3109INsMg-kiSA","Ugzv18EGbUQRhpkg46N4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"
"@TinyFlame I appreciate your viewpoint, and completely agree that if the dog shows indication of fear then something is not right. Nonetheless, the way his dogs respect and enjoy his company seems to be the exact opposite. So I do believe it is a form of positive punishment resulting in respect and love.

"@HappyTrails 1 just because it works, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay. Hitting a dog to get it to stop barking works, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs positive punishment so it would. But it‚Äôs still shitty to do. Correcting a dog at all is also considered positive punishment. Adding something to decrease the likelihood of a behavior recurring. Just because it works, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay. I didn‚Äôt look at the video, but I‚Äôm going to make the assumption that the dog was either panting, had it‚Äôs tail low and did fairly strong short wags in that position, avoided eye contact with the handler, had its head down, looking away from the handler a lot, avoiding them (leaning away, looking away and avoiding eye contact), or was lip licking or yawning consistently or when asked to preform behaviors. Those are behaviors that usually indicate low confidence, insecurity, fear, or being nervous. If they don‚Äôt show these, okay. I don‚Äôt care. If they do, it further proves my point. If you don‚Äôt want to listen to me, here‚Äôs a study.

https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2013/06/the-end-for-shock-collars.html?m=1
A test done on 3 groups of dogs where one group was trained using shock collars.

This is a little example about how punishment results in stress. Ignore me if you want though. Just please avoid spreading this outlook. It‚Äôs not healthy.

"Sounds like maybe you moved too quickly when first introducing the harness/leash/walk. Lots of people do, and it's not usually an issue until you have a nervous dog. If he loves his normal meal time or play time, pull out the leash/harness first then put it away and do the favorite thing and make a fuss. Slowly, re-introduce putting the leash/harness as a positive/fun thing. Then he wears the harness during games/feed time, then you put it on and ""walk"" to the front door for a couple of days until he is relaxed doing that. Then you go into the front yard for a couple of days and slowly move down the street ALWAYS ending on a positive with a big fuss. Try to end the walk session before he starts to stress. 
If you stay relaxed an happy the progress will happen quicker than you think.","Jac B","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjqHfb1CA3m-F2vUMvx3XbhfeYwbiUuvBDw5A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2HP1mAL39lK1NgZFaTe8kA","UC2HP1mAL39lK1NgZFaTe8kA","0","0","2020-02-18T08:28:30Z","2020-02-18T08:28:30Z","UgxRYmMx2zLgeq6SkBR4AaABAg.94qfUM9AU4s95APK0CZmTw","UgxRYmMx2zLgeq6SkBR4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

"@Anumvella Exactly, plus there's almost no traffic, and the few passing by cars can also be part of the training, in the sense of rising awareness to them. And it's not like Zak is going to endanger his own dog or any other dog. Also, sidewalks have grass, and dogs can be tempted and eat it and without a fully vaccinated dog, grass is dangerous. I am quite sure Inertia is properly vaccinated, but isn't still an adult, so her immune system might not be as solid as a two/three old.","At√≥ Nito","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnimLRx-oTd-HCqrOHyoJv2bDwTT-GUFPqkd40nUTA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy2Q18-mB2Ruap35vU6nUGQ","UCy2Q18-mB2Ruap35vU6nUGQ","0","0","2021-01-06T13:51:30Z","2021-01-06T13:53:56Z","Ugz7d9rbaqub300tgHl4AaABAg.94RSlJBwrDN9IAg2JFkmU8","Ugz7d9rbaqub300tgHl4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"
"This is done at the start of training your dog to walk on a leash because usually the pavement holds many more distraction opportunities. Smells from people drudging things under their feet, half eaten food or rubbish (Depending on place) or even the biggest distraction: dogs having peed. Walking in the middle of a quiet road is much less distracting and a great way to start, helps your dog focus on you and doesnt make it even more difficult than it needs to be. After a while you can move on to training on the pavement. 
As for the people saying its more dangerous, obviously one needs to use their common sense about how and when to do this. As for the not running to the road, ideally one learns recall as well as emergency recall, boundaries (the pavement is another boundary) etc.","Anumvella","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngLwXzDfX6EAq2xTLdezNPBaH9u8vNsQI_N0d2l=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGjOPVib3VLTGlm2Xz7Ox-A","UCGjOPVib3VLTGlm2Xz7Ox-A","0","2","2020-12-22T11:43:23Z","2020-12-22T11:43:23Z","Ugz7d9rbaqub300tgHl4AaABAg.94RSlJBwrDN9HZpSrjzf2I","Ugz7d9rbaqub300tgHl4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

It's crazy, our dogs pull on the leash, and get way excited and bark at other dogs during the walk, but one thing they don't do, is try to walk in the street, LOL.

"@Julie Nowak - I feel for you - my (now 7) young dog went from being a normally socialised, if highly strung, puppy, to a fear reactive dog who cannot be allowed to interact with other dogs. She had two seasons back to back which meant she was dealing with raging hormones, and had to be kept away from other dogs, for a few months (we couldn't get her spayed during this time). She has never recovered - so I wish you luck - if any methods can help they will be Zak's - but don't be afraid to use any local services available - one to one training works well!!","honeychurchgipsy6","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnibZ6xZkNGMSfXKkr-4vk7qeMyiOtFVbsIIUlql=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuqGXuItBgWaujL_2TE3zQ","UCXuqGXuItBgWaujL_2TE3zQ","0","0","2020-12-27T18:13:58Z","2020-12-27T18:13:58Z","Ugztu8CXNNCeanTkGZ54AaABAg.93xTe5IxykF9HmP7rjYAEa","Ugztu8CXNNCeanTkGZ54AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

"@KaetheGoat i wasn't gonna say anything but i'll give you a perspective. In camping, there's a difference in the man who went out to chop his own wood to stay warm, and the guy who plugged in the electric heater to his car. Much like a dog, there is a difference between the dogs you see in obedience trials and on the TV and Internet. The obedience trial dogs are the ones who went out to chop their own wood. 90% of the trainers on the internet, own  dogs similar to the camper who brought the electric heater. 

In all seriousness though, don't use a fire unless you absolutely have to. There are enough forest fires and pollution as is. You have what it takes, but if you go online and ask people you are plugging in that electric heater. Stop it, go ask several trainers firstly, because you have to see how unsuccessful most of them are compared to the real ones, and secondly, there is too much bullshitting going around that will waste years of productivity.","70","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjOwyUD_OLQRhmkkPczqw7U53toI2MelEmSS7H82Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrskqFC9f5Yfc4x5ZEYIDCw","UCrskqFC9f5Yfc4x5ZEYIDCw","0","0","2020-01-18T21:49:20Z","2020-01-18T22:05:27Z","Ugx8he4SjHiT0j-WnbB4AaABAg.93sZdD7fup_93x0KJCq2n5","Ugx8he4SjHiT0j-WnbB4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

"Ugh how? Ive had my border collie/german spitz mix raven since she was 6 weeks old, on the 28th of this month she'll be 1 (where does the time goüò•). I can stay outside with her for 6, 7, 8 hours, feeding her water and food the whole time as I'm pretty much begging her to ""go potty"",  and she will hold it usually until the very second we get back in the house. A trainer i had spoken with suggested that i crate her the very second we come back inside, then take her out about an hour or so later and try again, if she still wont go, repeat until she does go outside.On the downside it has made her hate the create It ended up working-kinda. She peed and pooped, a little, but i was so excited that she actually went outside that i didnt really pay attention to the fact that it was just a very small amount, we go back inside and i turn to lock the door, when i turn back towards Raven i am greeted by the rest of what she should have finished letting go of outside. Its so frustrating, not to mention my house stinks and my kitchen floor (yep kitchen hallway floor(i live in a very tiny studio)) has literally been destroyed (property mgr isn't too thrilled, to put it mildly).

But people have clicker trained tigers so you're argument that some ""powerful dogs"" need harsher training methods in order to do their job just stems from an ego that should be checked.
As far as military dogs, I never said anything about that realm of training. Zak doesn't claim to train military/police dogs. He's giving free training to people who want to successfully train their PETS at home. 
But those ""powerful and energetic"" dogs have been around longer than prong collars, choke chains, and shock collars. How on Earth did they manage those BEASTS before them?!

"Juan Quiceno you are trying to get training tips for your dog off of YouTube, and there are many variants and factors that would go into the questionable behavior that your dog does when he/she puts a leash on. It can‚Äôt be summed up in one answer. I‚Äôm guessing you just want a quick fix to your problem, and maybe it would be a quick fix if you actually got a trainer to tell you exactly why your dog is doing what it does, and how to fix it. Stop asking complex questions expecting simple solutions to those questions. Get a trainer.","Faith M.","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj7uDeHpu6LeU0GmJzS_gTl0wdi7WB4URdLnzA8=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIQiVkrlBXVh3k8uuY5WbcA","UCIQiVkrlBXVh3k8uuY5WbcA","0","0","2020-02-11T00:28:04Z","2020-02-11T00:28:04Z","UgwudNS3BIR31W7nS8F4AaABAg.93cZBYPW-av94sWm03Wk7u","UgwudNS3BIR31W7nS8F4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"

Sometimes, those clinics will offer discounts if the pet parent meets certain qualifications (low income, veteran, or senior citizen for a few). Also, check with your county's animal control.

"Absolutley!! As a beginning dog trainer, I'm really trying to emphasize that hugely! In fact, really trying to separate walking on-leash from exercise at first: using the walk as a very specific exercise (with a leash just for it), in boring places like in house and backyard to learn the on-leash technique. Doing actual exercise separately using fetch, tug... Don't walk your dog while they're in training to get YOUR exercise. You both need to get your exercise by other means until leash-work is learned. üòäüíï I think that takes a lot of stress off to approach it that way.... And-- Love you Zak!

Another thing to try, do a couple tricks with the leash behind your back, then bring out the leash without acknowledging it, don‚Äôt make it a big deal, just keep doing tricks. If she is skittish, try just having part of it sticking out from behind your back so she knows it‚Äôs there. Also, when you feed her, have the leash on the ground next to her. This will create positive association. And, I highly, highly recommend getting a long leash (15 ft - 100 ft depending on how big your yard is) to put on her when she goes outside. To make this less scary, play fetch with the long leash next to you and one time when she comes back, attach it and immediately throw the ball. Don‚Äôt hold onto it because that could scare her. Gradually, you can start playing fetch in the door way to outside, then put on her long leash, throw the ball outside, and hold onto it. Make sure there is no tension (this is why you should use a long leash so it doesn‚Äôt scare her.) you can start walking outside with her with the leash on, still playing fetch. Then call her from wherever you are and just keep walking forward and calling her, holding onto the leash. Soon you can start playing fetch, then put a short leash on her but do not pick it up. Then when you call her you can try picking it up and walking forward, then calling her. Have her wear the long leash inside the house all day (you must insist that she have it on because otherwise, she will be under the impression that she decides if she gets a leash or not.) Then call her out the front door, as if you were going for a walk. Just hold onto the end of the long leash and she should be fine and have plenty of room to roam. Make it just like going outside in the backyard. You don‚Äôt have to force her to ‚Äúgo for a walk‚Äù but just let her smell things and then call her to see if she will come, maybe play some fetch. This should help! Be sure to insist that she wears the leash inside (the long one) so when you leave the house it‚Äôs not anything different.","Natalie Wainwright","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniBTNikNjjni4RRhPK27sDSKk6LWFjp6MhfOKqo-Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0H0B9fTrvoC4iYnqzsTwtw","UC0H0B9fTrvoC4iYnqzsTwtw","0","0","2020-01-07T21:43:45Z","2020-01-07T21:43:45Z","Ugx8tAlnsu_aiv1kiDR4AaABAg.93RnmSClqBD93VfwlpGJos","Ugx8tAlnsu_aiv1kiDR4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"
"@Natalie Wainwright Thank you so much for breaking down the steps for me! This is so helpful. Repetition and consistency is key!


One last question though, when I just put the leash next to her without attaching it, she always move to another location. She always try to avoid getting near it. She will take a few treats and then move away. Do I need to keep at it or do you have another method that I can try?","Surishta","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngXHl5JAh2_97JbwATIrFxWLHVyeSBgkS59tyYUdg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSeieGqeGzeUBbno9pMbKA","UCUSeieGqeGzeUBbno9pMbKA","0","0","2020-01-07T07:09:19Z","2020-01-07T07:09:19Z","Ugx8tAlnsu_aiv1kiDR4AaABAg.93RnmSClqBD93U6sBUIekX","Ugx8tAlnsu_aiv1kiDR4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"
"I have had the exact same problem! What I did is first make sure they‚Äôre comfortable walking around with their harness/collar inside the house. After they get used to walking around with it on, start getting them used to having the leash around them. Not attached, but just maybe on the ground or next to them. You want to make sure they dont have any anxiety about the leash (or harness/collar.) Try using food when the leash comes out to make a positive association. Next, attach the leash but don‚Äôt hold onto it. Give lots of praise and encourage them to move around. Then you can try putting on a super long leash, holding onto the end, and letting her outside. She should be fine with that since she has plenty of room to run. You can hold onto the leash anywhere you want. Start at the end, then move toward where it is attached. When back inside, put a short leash on and try some tricks. This can make the dog more used to having the leash. Try doing everyday activities with the short leash on. Maybe feed her while holding her leash. Walk around the house with it on (if she is not ready for this try the ‚Äúcome command‚Äù or treats as lures). Then put the long leash on and go for a walk. She is used to having something hanging from her and knows she has room to roam so she should be fine. Like I said earlier, gradually get closer to where it‚Äôs attached. Repeat these steps over a number of days. The best way to get a dog comfortable is to repeat it. I recommend not making ‚Äúgoing for a walk‚Äù a task or job. Don‚Äôt use heel, because the goal is to get her comfortable, so just let her do what she wants if she is on the leash. If she wont walk, first call her and if she doesn‚Äôt come, you may have to pull her a bit until she understands that she must go where you go. Hope this helped!

"Not an expert but i think you are confusing your dog by rewarding it when it let's go. Instead the dog thinks you are rewarding the biting and now associates the biting w the treats. 

What worked w my puppy was to completely stop and ignore the dog. Look up so the dog clearly sees you are ignoring. Start turning in a slow circle away from the dog if it just stays clamped but stop completely again without acknowledging the dog if it starts growling. Last resort for me  would be distract w hands or a toy but do not give either to the dog. Here's the important part: only when the dog let's go, then ask the dog to sit or perform some other trick and then,  when they have done it, reward. You want to associate the reward w the trick the dog is doing and not w the biting.

"My puppy used to do this. I would say its partly that he's ""grown"" out of it but also partly that his learned that trying to get into my pockets will not get him treats. My advice is try ""treat train"" him. So let him see the treats in your pockets but cover w your hand while he tries to get them. Wait until he stops and then ask him to perform a simple act like ""sit"" and only after he does then reward w treat.

"@Blond_Albatraoz _ so true my puppy knows the meaning of Break, Yes,  No, leave it and Out, wich are so so so  important especially when you dont have treats to bribe your dog like zak does and your dogs about to eat some thing possibly dangerous or about the nibble on a electrical cable etc..  Zak looks like a positive only trainer wich is good 95% of the time but you need that 5% for corrections and If needed punishment and I dont mean hitting the dog or shouting foul language but a time out in the cage or a 15 minutes on there place mat so they know when there wrong and what's acceptable behaviours. Teaching and Saying ""No"" to your dog doesn't hurt or lower there drive or even change the personality but gives them structure and confidence so they know what they can and cant do and up most of all good manners.

"HI Zak, we have been watching your videos for some time, and have both of your books as well. Having said that however, I don't think Maddog was questioning the quality or size of the treats which you give Inertia. I think the concern is more about frequency and is the treat given sometimes unnecessary? That's the way I feel,  perhaps if you just sit down some quiet evening and watch one or two of these recent videos you may see it too. I'm also thinking of some dear folks who maybe have just gotten their first puppy and are following in your footsteps, and how it may begin to cause some health concerns with their pups by overfeeding, or even financially overbuying treats to train when not necessary. Please look at today's video yourself and see how many times you took a step or two then treat, then a few more moves then treat (over 150 times treats were given in this vid). You're a good guy Zak, and you mean well, and you are great fun to watch. But quite honestly from the heart, your older videos with other peoples dogs were the reasons why I bought your books.","Ken","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnh4RK-G-E6MaHEp4NQ_kPBAvVaFGEF7IGYTwQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCADuNDNMJPgg4r8o6sRoz7A","UCADuNDNMJPgg4r8o6sRoz7A","0","2","2020-01-05T19:05:41Z","2020-01-11T23:00:46Z","UgxxB0PyHZQ405WKW3d4AaABAg.93Q72lN2dvb93QFGK23W16","UgxxB0PyHZQ405WKW3d4AaABAg","kTxL82Dp-XM"
