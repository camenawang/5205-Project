"That dashboard is a poor repeat of the Citroen C6 dahsboard but have you ever rented a car arriving at an airport one evening and find yourself stuck with only tablets without buttons (Ford Flex, MB C200, Citroen Cactus) and I could not get the defrost to run and it was snowing outside. I prefer the dashboard of the Peugeot 508 which is the most ergonomic, nicest an coolest dashboard. I can explain why Tesla will not allow you to use their full autopilot as they keep having accidents during daytime and their cameras cannot handle rain, I do research in that area and certification of these will not happen before some decades yet.","laurentien00","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng2wQhsWGArN1dloG6mbB-VRq49q2xWqbNq8A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCceIl1k6x2NmZsh1_YgrdMg","UCceIl1k6x2NmZsh1_YgrdMg","0","0","2021-02-22T19:17:49Z","2021-02-22T19:17:49Z","UgxMPxEeE7u1n8bcbUt4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"I just unsubscribed due to titling: Graham has got his titles perfect for instilling fear, stomach tension and anxiety at just about every video simply as click-bait. There is nothing to any of this fear and anxiety: no big crisis in any single video - it's just brain manipulation. I'm tired of watching my stomach tighten just reading the videos so I don't want them in my feed. The content is decent - as it always has been - but in the last six months or so I would say Graham has shifted from providing peak value respectfully to manipulating his audience and using his audience for his income: hence the upsurge in fear and drama with a reduced concentration of truly relevant content. I think Graham could create a steadier burn and justify the channel doing one video a week on something that really mattered, enjoying life more and cutting the FUD.","Dane Rose","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjkr54qt431h4YkD7hbrseRCwlWEOGrtYaO-STw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFEZdMekWHyUmbnOdEEFgQ","UCVFEZdMekWHyUmbnOdEEFgQ","0","0","2021-01-21T23:48:02Z","2021-01-21T23:48:02Z","UgzsG48Ky6FdYkimqYF4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Everyone is mentioning the charger cable lock being to prevent the anti-Tesla crowd from yanking the plug out maliciously, but there's other points to consider:
Electrical Arc and Safety. The charger cable is (obviously) supplying electricity to the car's internal charge circuitry. A rather significant amount of current (Amps) is required, and suddenly connecting/disconnecting a plug while that much ""juice"" is flowing can lead to sparks/shock (standing in a puddle in your driveway while it's raining?) and the electrical arc will damage the plug, either dramatically all at once, or gradually over time and repetition.
This is purely speculation. I've been working on cars for 27 years, and electronics and PCs have been a hobby for even longer. I would imagine a fair bit of the price of a Tesla boils down to engineering. (I make that assumption partly on the overabundance of tech where simple mechanicals would suffice - glove compartment door, for example...) I would also assume that the engineers designing the charging circuit would plan a few different ""cut-offs"" for the charging to address safety concerns, pranks, and longevity of the charging port/integrity of the connection during a charge cycle. Those are the types of things I would think of if I were in their shoes.","DashCamAndy","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhFITghw2dpHPr2ceoUYR0zGZZDt789-mXxcco=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6YQm1AuIsvd_3pebefMjw","UCE6YQm1AuIsvd_3pebefMjw","0","0","2020-10-19T03:20:34Z","2020-10-19T03:20:34Z","Ugw8K1ALJ2wJLkbKtkl4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Your mistake with options when you purchased was you did not calculate the actual cost of those options after business deductions.  You did short-sighted analysis on all the options - seats, color, and range.  It probably would have been, what, a buck fifty per month for the seats and another 2 bucks for red paint?   Limited range was your big screw up, as you have found out - especially trying to use the car in LA as a real estate developer.  The old adage is true, ""Quality in the beginning is savings in the end.""  I would have taken the white seats, maximum range, and pretty much any color except grey, white, or black.  Or I would have paid to get the car painted or wrapped, as you apparently did.  The wrap looks nice, but your lifetime cost there probably is close to the $2k red paint job.  One other thing you did not mention - how far out of the way does one need to go to get to a recharging station?  Most people in LA do not own a house.","Norman Rogers","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngz8ZOzjZBiGWNKtqzgWAMIlZJ18LieXozaCQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCedEu_cHEu74aju6t8ZyF_Q","UCedEu_cHEu74aju6t8ZyF_Q","0","0","2020-10-12T18:19:44Z","2020-10-12T18:19:44Z","UgwxpPD8wclVTOxuceZ4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Things to add that we've learned after 2 years of ownership:
1) The Tesla has a 12V battery in the frunk area, similar to your standard ICE. Having done some research after having ours die, it serves a crucial role to the car. Unfortunately, in our case, it renders the car completely inoperable until it is replaced and there is no option to just jump start the battery like on an ICE car. Apparently the car is supposed to warn you when the battery is near dead, but our car did no such thing. And Apparently the battery pack is supposed to recharge the 12V with a DC to DC converter, but again...ours did not do that. Luckily, our car was under warranty for this and Tesla covered it all for free....the repair, replacement, tow and even paid for the Uber to pick me up when the car was done.
2) Full Autonomous auto-pilot is a joke at that price. I guarantee you Tesla will perfect it and will initially try and sell it for a ridiculous price, only to have other EV manufacturers sell the feature for much less when the tech becomes more common. There is just no justifying that price unless you absolutely love looking like a show off. 
3) On about 3 occasions, we have had the screen go completely blank or pixelize and become useless. The car would still drive, but all of your ancillary functionality is immediately lost until the system reboots. Kind of a vulnerable feeling because you don't know what else is going to shut off during that time. Although the minimalist approach can seem attractive, having absolutely everything tied to the touch screen definitely has its drawbacks.","Charles Nuno","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniluTIy5dB1sPBEvv86uSxRloJeedIf4vK28WjE=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9pcclBvcdD-a7eVRMAZmw","UCU9pcclBvcdD-a7eVRMAZmw","0","11","2020-09-03T18:11:57Z","2020-09-03T18:11:57Z","Ugw5AKhkX-NmR0uIeuh4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"instead of a 70-75 kw battery and a weight of 600 kg it is better to divide the battery in two. one of 10-15 kw and 100 kg permanent with a range of 100 km that would be enough for the city and a standard battery of 60 kw and 500 kg detachable to rent when you leave the town. instead of stopping at the peco to fill up for the road you can go to an electric charging point in your city and mount a standard 60 kw battery from there and on the way to replace it at another electric charging point with one loaded. the first advantage is that it would save a lot of batteries in the world, especially since the 2 million km batteries will appear, which practically do not wear out and must be fully exploited. if a car is lighter by 500 kg, I think it will have a significantly greater autonomy in the city. this would be the second advantage. a short recharge time of up to 5 minutes to change the battery would be another advantage. the price of electric cars would drop by half. lazy people who do not want to charge the car every night or people who have range anxiety can use both batteries permanently with the assumption of costs.

"New to this channel, no idea who that guy is.
I'm currently deciding whether to get a Model 3, so I'm watching a lot of pro and con videos.
So far, I'd say it's near impossible to find a sincere video on the cons.
Usually, people will say nonsense like how they regret not getting their Tesla in a different color. Or how the rims scratch easily.

So here I am again, abandoning this video before the 2 minute mark.
He already lost me when he said he was not going for the YouTube sensationalism when literally his title says, ""the TRUTH about the Model 3"". Caps included.

I'm so, so tired of all that petty clickbait bullshit.
And even after 2 minutes of a 18 minutes videos he still hasn't said anything remotely useful or relevant, it's all just hot air and blah blah. What waste of time. Yet again.","smaller cathedrals","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngODwJamVSFmLixccgWuNZ_FfpCzgVOOIHtf6-1=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWenwK30sUOz_0UrS0Fvn7Q","UCWenwK30sUOz_0UrS0Fvn7Q","0","0","2020-08-15T06:43:43Z","2020-08-15T06:43:43Z","UgyXjsgC1GigQOcm8v14AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"The reason the charge plug does not pull out without you being there is because someone else might pull it out while you are taking a long break when you are on the road.  So you come back after a meal and restroom break and find your car hasn’t been charging, with the no pull out feature this can’t happen.  You also failed to mention that charging at home will be at least half the cost of gasoline, in some places it could be just 1/5 the price of gas to go the same no. of miles. Also no tuneups, no oil changes, almost no brake jobs because of regen braking.  Also insane acceleration.  All around just a fun car to drive.  Love my model S LR+ with an EPA range of 402 miles. I like the fact that on a hot day you can sit in your car and run the AC while in Park, no engine needs to be running like an ICE car, ditto with the heater on a cold day.","Macguy","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjsER4u6VIYRWtydvkjRtZ0ci2U2efazMC8AQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkqNIDGOFQAgMpOCLV3HnQ","UCmkqNIDGOFQAgMpOCLV3HnQ","0","0","2020-07-29T21:22:38Z","2020-07-29T21:23:14Z","UgzGEFnsMPSrGREOueR4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

It is still the primer yellow. Honestly, with all of the misses in the paint, I would have taken it back.

"Hey Graham, just to answer your thoughts about recording audio with Sentry mode, there are legal implications. Some states and countries allow recording of audio with video, but it usually is fairly uncommon too. I do a lot CCTV work in New Jersey, and the usual work around is if you are ""actually a part of the conversation"", you can record audio. This means if you are actively watching the camera and are able to respond to whomever is near the camera with a microphone. I am not sure about laws in other states, but I assume some are stricter than that and would require a bit more in depth research. I have some thoughts as to how Tesla could approach this, but it would probably only resolve the issue for some states and countries and most likely cause the battery to drain faster.","Colin Morin","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjaA2iQizFqb2V_x9XPUHLBmSOoC7x_0xv7iDgm=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusYa8x49g3_2aCzkfceSGQ","UCusYa8x49g3_2aCzkfceSGQ","0","0","2020-07-25T00:45:30Z","2020-07-25T00:45:30Z","UgzA9-cZ-mSi9D25T3R4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"The ""locking"" charging cable is not a glitch.  You don't want someone to be able to remove the charging cable while you're waiting at a restaurant nearby.  I've had to go back into the house to get my phone to remove the cable on the car sitting in the garage - meh.  BTW, stop being so cheap:  get a Tesla home charger for your garage.  Charging from a 110 v is pathetic.  We got the LR with the acceleration boost and the white interior - cannot say enough good about it.  Upgrade the interior LED lights and also add the sound deadening kits all available by 3rd party internet providers (RPMTesla is a good one).  Well worth the time and effort  - again don't be cheap.","Dieter Zerressen","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhJQ9POz_5KnkNNNmK3eWqB8Q3WdVKPKu5LH9JIDg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxy1KpWMizb21jVfU9vK-g","UCgxy1KpWMizb21jVfU9vK-g","1","0","2020-07-21T02:33:11Z","2020-07-21T02:33:11Z","UgwyBf1YHg4lTXWPfaJ4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@7:00 about recording audio without the other person's consent.  That's only an issue for states that are known as ""Two-Party Consent States"" like for example Florida, but for states that are known as ""One Party Consent States"" like for example New York then it is not an issue.  As long as at least one party of a conversation is ok with the recording than its a legal court admissible recording.  However, there could be some ""gray area"" where if you capture an audio conversation where you are not the party of a conversation that is happening within a group of person but for that, you would need to speak with a lawyer just to clear things up and make sure if in that case, it's legal because you own the vehicle and you gave consent to that recording happening.  

* The one and two-party content laws are more geared to phone conversations, but I don't see how it cannot be extended into a video conversation especially if you are a party to that conversation 

* This is not legal advice, I provide this info as-is.  Do your own research to be 100% sure if in your own particular case your recordings can be defended with the ""One-Party Consent"" Doctrine.","m8ty.com","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnicp2EauaM0mXN5Gj-TopvGaFdjo5k6Qrug5g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLh3POa1-XipXdGa3XAIdpw","UCLh3POa1-XipXdGa3XAIdpw","0","5","2020-07-17T06:54:06Z","2020-07-17T06:54:06Z","UgzJb07Y0csg3jLITmR4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"I feel like a lot of people forget the fact that Tesla was one/the first company to ever make an electric car + semi-self driving. When you pay that much money for a car, the point is that it's always getting better even AFTER you pay for the car. Due to software updates. You need to give them some props for that. The ""empty promises"" part I fully agree with. Although, it's hard for Elon Musk to fully put a time on something, when the Electric car business/self driving business is so new to reality.

"so I'm guessing for a person that doesn't like wasting money, he's on a special friend deal for the iphone pro, am waiting for that review next.  I don't think people that buy a tesla, shop at home depot, they have people that do that for them. Sounds like requirement to open the door when charging is to stop the plug from being stolen or an idiot that thinks it would be funny to pull it out while charging. Pretty much states what he doesn't like is how the like of apple etc have made their billions, on selling or up selling, pay us a monthly fee that you're possibly already paying someone else for a similar service, eg data etc.  Maybe an alternative self driving car would be the better comparison, eg vovlo, bmw, merc etc etc. Also, Musk has a track record of this is going to happen by xyz, but in reality, much like star trek etc, the technology is still many many years off, but I'm sure (like apple gets credit for certain things) Musk fans will always credit Musk for these promised features down the track.","Neil MacIntosh","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjbdVRg07bkBGBlRGk8Xmqvtg19phE2F0GUSw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHXDu9ffGu5Z78uQfVmWvvA","UCHXDu9ffGu5Z78uQfVmWvvA","0","0","2020-07-13T06:02:50Z","2020-07-13T06:14:49Z","Ugz0Z-rui70SQIyhIkZ4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Hello Everyone out there,I am here to give my testimony about a Herbalist called Dr Bob, I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 2 in 2019, i went to many hospitals for cure but there was no solution, so I was thinking on how i can get a solution out so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the pool side Browsing and thinking where I can go get a solution. I saw a blog on how Dr Bob cured people, i did not believe but i just decided to give him a try, I contacted him and he prepare the herbs for me which i took, and he instructed me to go for check up, after the test i was confirmed herpes negative, i am so happy. If you have any problem or you are also infected with any disease, kindly contact him now with his Email:

"I am at 14,000 miles and I love my Tesla like crazy!   But here are a couple of things I do not like about my Tesla Model 3.
If you did not buy the package for streaming music then you must use your phone to pair and steam music using your phone data sharing feature.
While this is still great as a workaround it seems that stupid things happen that should not happen at all.
While the car is in park and you then connect your phone for data sharing so streaming music can be played then the following happens.
You put the car from park into reverse......   Wifi will be automatically disabled.  So then you put the car into drive then turn on the wifi yet again to connect to streaming.
Drive condition should NEVER affect WIFI choice!

Second.  We love our Tesla cart so much we always want the car connected to WIFI once the car is parked for the day at home so you connect your car to your home wifi.
So far so great yes?      Yes but it seems if you are a hard core gamer and you play any MMO game with the tesla connected to your home wifi network
then you just might start seeing a lot of lag.   
Yeah so your Tesla will be a game killer if you are into a lot of PVP.
So if you know you will be doing a lot of PVP battles then when still in the car then just turn off your Tesla wifi.","Inachu Ikimasho","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnh2q852B7zGWVPTgTgTIbwWGYyBuhC_QG0hv_yG-g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXbwnBAPeEnVDI8104bH6Q","UCZXbwnBAPeEnVDI8104bH6Q","0","0","2020-07-09T15:06:43Z","2020-07-09T15:06:43Z","UgwE8Z49o9WIYU_Lsa14AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Purchasing a vehicle from Tesla, which is propped up on the $2.3B sales of carbon credits (with a total of $4B income) does not seem like a smart move. Tesla pokes fun at internal combustion engines but it depends on them for more than half its profits through cap and trade. If, in theory, Tesla sales spiked massively, that would create lower demand for carbon credits (less internal combustion vehicles), this would cause lower income as sales increase--it seems like an unstable business plan.","Paige Chamberlain","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjRymlZuySpMQNycjF_6P2T-1_B81QFIdNvgFwG5GM=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjd2jQlo-7A3BJOLKR_RHJA","UCjd2jQlo-7A3BJOLKR_RHJA","0","0","2020-07-05T23:28:43Z","2020-07-05T23:28:43Z","Ugy6_0j1L5IcWJhxC_t4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"A few faults aside, I have come over to believing it is the best commonly available EV. I have wavered for a while due to the instability of the fearless leader and I suspect some disinformation from other vested interests ""coz that's how they roll"" just ask em about how they handle lawsuits! I also am dubious about the OTA which could nobble the car with a bad update or if it decides it is not a genuine car due to  some glitch in the software and shut me out of the system. 
Also I live in Adelaide South Australia where 45 degree C days are common in summer. Not a lot of data about how much mileage gets lost to cooling on a hot day when driving or parked. I was surprised to see how much underspray there was on your car. Very poor when compared to even a basic conventional car. At the end of the day, after a few whangs at  a shopping centre, a concours finish is not high on my list but I do expect full coverage fort the protection aspect.  Prices in OZ are not as encouraging either thanks to the exchange rate. Drive away price on a base Model 3 with no options is $79,087 AUD. We do get some discount on stamp duty and luxury tax but the difference over a normal car would buy a lot of fuel and the break even point would be well over 100,000 kilometres. 
If I had the money, I would still buy one for the driving experience and the novelty especially if I had home solar. I would still keep my diesel for the long  trips. I have no ambition to go on a roadtrip with an EV until they bring out the hyped million mile battery with enough range to drive all day and recharge overnight at my destination. A lot of places in Oz where infrastructure is thin on the ground between capitals.","Rogy Doj","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngIzD4KPK_gE3JA9fJjPjBCh8USp9Lpy3rAPw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMoo3YBlWborN6v_d8gUjQ","UCsMoo3YBlWborN6v_d8gUjQ","0","1","2020-07-05T04:33:52Z","2020-07-05T04:40:23Z","UgxGmiy6hxUfAAZNBkV4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"For the average consumer this car makes no financial sense. In fact very little cars make financial sense, they all depreciate and they all cost us money. It's just a sunk cost we have to accept. But the Tesla is no better in this regard. The only real savings is gas, which is more than offset by the higher payment. Buy a Tesla if you want but dont expect to be writing off expenses to the point that it costs you $78/month to own one. Realistically you'll have a $500/month payment and maybe $60/month gas savings.

"This guy is just trying to find reasons to critisize Tesla for stupid reasons that no other car on the market doesn't even have those functionalities. I mean No car company would give all season mats, the point of charging plug lock  is for someone to not pull the plug when ur not there. if u are too lazy to unlock it then you shouldnt buy tesla and any other car because in other cars u will have the problem of filling the gas, and with your laziness it will be hard for you honey.  He is blaming supercharges because they are not fast enough to charge when ur in rush, ohh god cmon then dont buy fucking tesla go get gas car, or charge your car earlier, its a common problem in all electric cars, and no other electric car brand has super charger, so u gotta charge ur car to full in 7 hours minimum with other cars, you are just being so stupidly dumb and trying to find reasons to critisize this car. Tell me a reason that u cannot find in this car and can find in other cars, Let me tell u by being an owner of tesla model 3. This car doesnt have sun roof , I dont use much so its not a problem for me, but it might be problem for some other people so it is a valid reason to critisize. It could be full glass + you can open the roof. The other thing about the car I hate is, the card reader is on the side  and only on the driver side and u have to pay $150 extra to buy car key to unlock or lock the car remotly,( or u can use the app for free but u need internet connection). The glovebox thing, if u were put the button there, u wouldnt be here to get views by critisizing Tesla in your stupid video, you would be an UI expert in your own business or big companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. I dont care how u like tesla or the company or elon, ur so miserable that you just use the companies reputation with stupid lies and trying to get views likes, ur disgusting.","Erdem Kepenek","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniizGyi-qoXjG_pz9VWFG5OaRflayvf4w1EY3fe=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjoL9F3uss6P14E7-ASGcmw","UCjoL9F3uss6P14E7-ASGcmw","0","0","2020-06-22T16:51:32Z","2020-06-22T16:51:32Z","UgyAlBwPzTB33D9-rOR4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"The man renamed his car ""smash the like button"", how can I not after that?
On a more serious note, I'm in a very similar boat to Graham (minus about a million net worth, hah), as soon as the SR+ was available in Canada I jumped on it. Doing the numbers against my Dodge Charger, with only 40% down it was the exact same monthly cost, and no risk of a transmission bricking itself, or any of the other risks of driving an old gas car. I never thought I'd buy a new car, but it just made sense. Especially since we had a $10,000 incentive here in Canada. My only real annoyance is how little features you could get from Tesla, but some have come after as post-delivery options, such as rear heated seats. Other options I modded in, like premium audio and ambient lighting. Only ended up costing me a little over a grand.","No Man's Land","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnh4qdSETYwcIa-Wsae4-Epcv4PFnZkLhrT_PxbB=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM9OQ7E9wx9RgxBvbg8xIiQ","UCM9OQ7E9wx9RgxBvbg8xIiQ","0","0","2020-06-13T18:47:19Z","2020-06-13T18:47:19Z","UgzAQf17acCCdbpep7l4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"When I saw the title, I was ready to be annoyed by this video, but it was actually very balanced and fair.  However, I think there are a few point to be rebutted: 

1. Problems disconnecting the charging cable.  I had this problem too.  When I first had the car, it seemed to work fine: press the button and the charging stopped and I could remove the cable.  Later, for some reason, I had the same problem as you: I had to open a door or unlock the charging port with my phone.  However, over the last week (it is now 13th June, 2020), it is working fine.  Maybe resolved with recent software releases?  

2. Having to press two buttons to open the glove box.  This (along with many other menu items) is solved with voice commands.  Just press the right button on the steering wheel and say ""Open the glove box"".  

3. Full self driving cost.  I agree, it is a lot of money for the current features, but I am getting more features all the time.  I now have stopping at traffic lights and stop signs, which still needs some tweaking, but is an excellent step towards full self driving.  I think it is also a bit confusing the way you refer to Autopilot and full self driving interchangeably.  AP comes free with the car and does a great job on highways and well marked roads.  Many people would be very satisfied with this and it will have the positive impact on driver fatigue that you mentioned.  

By the way, I went with Performance with white seats and have no regrets.","michaelfink64","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjxX4JyEmr9vvEq7wCQ3m-EPAI0MAwS7nRL8Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gcuosEZji9ovDGfXE-EQA","UC6gcuosEZji9ovDGfXE-EQA","0","0","2020-06-13T10:19:25Z","2020-06-13T10:19:25Z","UgxM3ocUZw0JChxajG54AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

Until we have full automation this is not a safe option for any car and thus illegal.","KotSR","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnh8gRgfS_HkCQ8ZTMCwCw0wH42maZPDvx4wLKWMlw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRGMUV61IFSigA2Qc-AhQsg","UCRGMUV61IFSigA2Qc-AhQsg","0","0","2020-06-12T23:59:46Z","2020-06-13T00:04:24Z","UgyojYWSggEQW5p6qYF4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

I´d like to compare the Price of the car in US and Europe (Spain) according with Tesla webpage. My choise is this car

•	Model 3 Long Range Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive$46,990
•	Pearl White PaintIncluded
•	19’’ Sport Wheels$1,500
•	All Black Premium InteriorIncluded
•	Purchase Price in u¡USA     $48,490
Excluding taxes and fees

Same car in Europe. (Spain)  $69,300  taxes included
We pay 10% tariff plus 21% VAT for the car.
Out of curiosity. How much do you pay in taxes and fees in USA for the same car?

"To make the Tesla App always work to instantly lock and unlock the car, enable ""persistent notifications"" if you're using an Android phone.

You should be able to tether your car to your phone over Wifi (phone as a WiFi hot spot).

For long road trips, don't charge to 100%.  The last 5% takes a long time due to battery physics.  The built in route planner will optimize this for you.  It's never necessary to spend more than 20 to 30 minutes to Supercharger on a long road trip, especially given that most superchargers on long distance highways are about 100 miles apart.

As you note, for most daily driving, most people charge at home and never use a public charger.

The paint on my Model 3 is nearly perfect.

"OK heres my experience owning the car for (2019 Model 3 AWD - 18K miles). I had to take it in twice for suspension issues that Tesla fixed for free because it was under warranty. The build quality on mine was okay other than some trim pieces they had to correct after living with it for a month and noticing it. Other than that it was a cool car, yet I could tell that the construction of it isn't made the best in terms of quality. Any AWD car costs more to maintain just because there are more components and if anything thats where your gonna see your problems down the line. Owning a Tesla out of warranty seems like a bad idea (do your research on this as there are plenty of Youtube videos on it). Sadly, I didn't wanna fall into the Tesla trap of always having a car note just so I can have a Tesla under warranty because its equivalent to a Ferrari or even more depending on the issue. The cars are unfortunately ahead of their time because nobody can repair them at a fair price nor repair them in a decent amount of time just yet. Tesla has a long way to go for making it worth the average persons time and money to own one out of warranty so I traded mine in and was offered 42K on a 2019 AWD with 18K miles. I went back to a petrol car and even though its not as cool as the Tesla in some regards, its better in the long run since I don't plan on keeping a car note just because of the worry of something going wrong.","Arnold Ram","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngBQdzORcvOpfmZO0RvjeHiMaMZNCEkcZi52N676A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDpFuDdIiDiGoUIRi2PcPAA","UCDpFuDdIiDiGoUIRi2PcPAA","0","1","2020-06-09T17:15:36Z","2020-06-09T17:15:36Z","UgzCqeosSTsjnLt7f_t4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Hey Graham, quick tip. You don’t actually have to open the door to remove the charging cable. There is a circle on top of the charger plug. Hold that down till the light turns baby blue and then you will be able to remove it. If the car is locked this won’t work but it’s a feature not a bug. If on the off chance that doesn’t work sometimes, you still don’t need to open the door. Just unlock the car from your app and then hold down the circle","Jeev !","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjsE-0UIr4ariTsZDiCkTNwzkXVp-fgl3oH=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8RO7PRW0pUyn9YXjOWFXmQ","UC8RO7PRW0pUyn9YXjOWFXmQ","0","0","2020-06-09T16:07:55Z","2020-06-09T16:07:55Z","Ugyi0iyD6oBNXPPfkS54AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

- talks about how the car keeps getting better every month with updates
- then covers this great feature, that great feature, this cool feature
- oh yeah the REGRETS REGRETS REGRETS he wishes he had bought the higher end model with white interior, it didn’t come with floor mats and the worst of the worst it takes two clicks to open the glove box

"The white interior actually doesn’t get dirty really. My model 3 has a white interior and I was honestly really impressed at how easy it is to keep clean and how hard it is to get dirty. I’ve gotten some pretty heavy duty stuff on the seats too - when I did lithography work I would accidentally get pure black, sticky, oily, heavy duty ink on the seats driving home. Didn’t have anything to clean it off at first so I had to leave the ink there for a couple days once. It all came of super easily and absolutely nothing that has gone on the seats while I’ve owned this car has managed to stain the seats or make them dirty at all. I was hesitant about white seats too, but they look awesome and are easy to maintain, I highly recommend them.","Lisa Wang","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngfGRKiw3IsvVZQVepeMKbFa9Z1TAAHJ4C_yphMbBs=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaanpUZqidkZv5eggs0Er8Q","UCaanpUZqidkZv5eggs0Er8Q","0","0","2020-06-08T21:16:16Z","2020-06-08T21:16:16Z","UgxW_sVYLEBx0qUNkPV4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"I have had ongoing problems with unreliable entry. Sometimes the auto function triggered by having the phone in your pocket as you approach the car doesn't work. I recently discovered that, if that happens,  it's easy enough to manually unlock by pulling out the phone and finding this feature on the app. But the question remains .. why the inconsistency? Why doesn't the auto feature work EVERY TIME (imagine if the same inconsistency was applied to the Space X rocket?). In short, we expect more of Tesla. Along the same lines, most of the time the key card (if one has to use it in place of the phone auto-entry or phone manual entry) is unreliable to effect the required response. I have had to 'Tap' it against the outside sensor multiple times (on several occasions) to get it to ""open the damn door"". Other negatives for me are the wiper controls on the screen (they require you to take your eyes off the road for too long to get the setting you need) and the temperature control and 'fan' features' (same problem). I find the guy in this video, Graham, a little underwhelming in his analysis.","Eamonn Morris","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjAaTwCxcmAOZO_LBE6mFGPUaJQVHWovnGxHobm=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznmUIurg4ZFCENj7YENBdg","UCznmUIurg4ZFCENj7YENBdg","1","0","2020-06-08T05:32:01Z","2020-06-08T05:32:01Z","UgzO-fl5w8R2TA8O9R14AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

And if Tesla engineers realized that most RVs are poorly designed rigid bubbles that could easily be improved upon - and then do something about it.

"8:50  Yesterday I pulled into a 150 kw supercharger station with 145 miles of range left on my LR 3.   I charged to 250 miles in 15 minutes.     Another time I pulled into an 75 KW charging station with 50 miles left and charged to 125 miles in 10 minutes.    You do not have to charge from empty to full.      In fact it takes 20 minutes to go from 300 miles to a full 320 mile charge on my 3.  Electric cars tend to charge very slow at 90% or above battery capacity. It is best to chargé between  10% to 70% of battery capacity to get the fastest charging speeds.","fatboy19831","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjB8Np9nigYf11wrxN4fixVRox5bBvclZXOFW1e=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGucFzvCdIfYBHRpZ6JaI_w","UCGucFzvCdIfYBHRpZ6JaI_w","2","20","2020-06-07T15:53:48Z","2020-06-07T15:53:48Z","UgysBO67qEf5a6sT6Ep4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"When calculating costs you forgot some major costs. A lot of states will charge you hundreds more dollars per year for electrical cars. This is because with electrical cars you are dodging gas tax so they get their revenue straight from you. They also say hybrids will depreciate a lot less than electrical cars. Also you may be able to write it down for business costs but a lot will not be able to. Also even though my state had 5k tax reduction on the list unless federal tax cuts are major it is still way more expensive than a used hybrid. I also don't think you get tax cuts on a used electrical car.","Eric Livingston","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjkMl7lH0PpccdKiNgnXKlO_dVjgVjoTWHD9w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaGqLFDtES3ZzVAz8ulotiQ","UCaGqLFDtES3ZzVAz8ulotiQ","0","0","2020-06-07T13:20:29Z","2020-06-07T13:20:29Z","UgzSw6WrVHq1cSR1O7x4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Dear S. Graham, i am sure you like you like your car as young people like iphones. Sadly a car works differently in part because is not a iphone. But im going to cut to the chase as i have been an auto tech for more than 13 years and i tell you that automakers that have close to 100 years still have things to improve,  and i tell you i have seen it all at the shop... and tesla are far from beeing good cars.. paint is going to be the least of your problems. Just like when you have health issues and you go the dr.. get a honest auto tech or have one as a friend and follow his advise. Also, Ussually you need to have 85k miles or more to find out if the car really was a good car, and not 15kmiles. Regards and good luck with the tesla.

"It enrages me that they call it ""full self-driving."" That name is misleading at best and reckless at worst. Level 5 autonomous driving is probably decades away. I'm the same age as Graham and I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see it in our life time. It turns out driving is hard and the human brain has to make a lot of complex decisions while driving. I really wish Graham wouldn't say it drives better than most people. It's probably accurate, but it's a long ways off someone with a lot of professional track instruction.","asparceproton1","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjku7OFZjD8gbSIGEJhzPHI4l0pwO8HemheTw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8hkfXkum8LN1ThPn9lvLw","UCr8hkfXkum8LN1ThPn9lvLw","1","0","2020-06-06T22:05:18Z","2020-06-06T22:05:18Z","Ugy9mkpWTnC7Rniy8N54AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"We've seen many interviews with Elon where he explains that all the cars have full self-driving features today, but it's the approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that's keeping it from happening right now. One could imagine that it all revolves around money. More electric cars equals billions lost in gas taxes, which equals less funding for highway repairs (which the electric cars will still utilize)... Auto driving equals less accidents (which is great), but this would equal less needs for tow trucks, auto repair shops, parts manufactures, parts delivery companies, auto part stores, cheaper insurance companies, not to mention ambulance chasing lawyers.. Autonomous driving would be a huge rock thrown in the money pond, and the following ripples would be very impactful to allot of industries. (Similar to why you'll NEVER see a flat income tax. About 10M jobs would go away overnight if that happened.)","Mark Clayton","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnijlSga74gxYlYz_0jy_IZRTowu633nV9Bcq8dO8eA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmCrT2q9CabB6-d5vbSnlzA","UCmCrT2q9CabB6-d5vbSnlzA","0","1","2020-06-06T17:44:57Z","2020-06-06T17:44:57Z","Ugwu5S4LY8m6xAoMm_t4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Pretty good car review man! One thing I did notice like many Tesla owners. You seem to accept the flaws in the car that no other car manufacturer does. And you still love the car. It’s rather odd given when you buy a car that’s brand new and flaw in the car is fixable by the manufacturer. Awful paint jobs, scratches & knicks, and inner door oddities are all not supposed to be there.  That’s not acceptable when you purchase a brand new car. Ever.... so why do tesla owners accept this upon taking delivery and just shrug it off as if it’s not there.  Kinda like dating a really crazy lady and just accepting her as crazy even though you know it’s unstable and toxic. Doesn’t work long term. Ever...","Michael Gorbaty","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjjjKdD0Uik8sz8e5vTjLJZRffMnAfWbm5hy5hdnQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJYQjdRdM28lLihPxqiIgSQ","UCJYQjdRdM28lLihPxqiIgSQ","1","0","2020-06-06T16:16:38Z","2020-06-06T16:17:58Z","Ugx16Ww566psxcTqB7V4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Graham, do NOT charge your Tesla from a normal electrical outlet if you don't know for sure the wiring dimensions is right or even if the outlet itself is okay to use for it. Check with an electrician. As somebody who works in the electric field myself, please listen to this.

"Hello from Canada! Nice update. With the recent price cut I was thinking of trading in my Audi for a Tesla.  However I’m torn between  an SR plus Or Performance. I agree and would also option out of the FSD and pay for it if and when it becomes legal as an autonomous taxi. Then it can drop me off at the train station,  head back home to take my kids to school, head out to make some money as a taxi . Etc 😀.  Realistically from a legal point of view autonomous taxi seems to be a long way out. However, It would be good to get some FSD features on a pay-as-you-go. Such as find me in a parking lot on a rainy day or if you are injured and couldn’t drive for a while. Also good point about the 110 plug, with this pandemic the standard plug would be sufficient.","Jurgen Vesst","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjuFbV33WFGkHafAnSpG_Bm0G3RU_DQ_S6lZQmg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCet7TcOt1GnwkgDZP0t1-IA","UCet7TcOt1GnwkgDZP0t1-IA","0","1","2020-06-06T14:37:49Z","2020-06-06T14:37:49Z","UgyMuWmokMsFIjZB_q14AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"I saw Jay Leno's Garage the other day and looks like ( No one knows this, well until now that is ) but Mr. Leno is going to be the 1st owner of the Roadster as he get more attention than anyone else when it comes to cars, then his friend will be number 2 which we all know. These guys are so lucky btw. Yes Graham, you will get the Roadster for free which is a no brainer because of your FREE money you make off of YouTube. But Joe Rogan who will be the number 2 guy on the list smoked weed with Elon Musk on his podcast and he was just on his podcast this time and OMG Joe Rogan is making so much cash that it makes me sick to know that you and Meet Kevin and Ryan Serhant were studs for raking in the cash AKA millions in the bank and easy money. But Rogan is moving to Spotify and telling YouTube and Apple to go pound sand and good for him. He won't be an announcer for much longer as his buddy Mike Goldberg got canned when his alcohol and drug problems caught up with him and Uncle Dana White kicked him to the curb. Rogan no longer needs the UFC, Dana White or silly shows like the Fear Factor from back in the day when he broke into the biz. But going back to the Roadster, there is going to be a few token people that everyone knows that will get this car and thank God it won't be fricken Kylie Jenner because that would give the brand a bad name and she would most likely kill herself driving from Calabasas to Las Vegas and trying to go 255mph from Barstow to Baker on that beautiful stretch of straight line that seems to end way to fast for me anyways, as I only did 165 in my 2010 BMW M3 V8. I was going to get a Tesla but I can't stand the no sound. In my M3 I had to not blast the music with the Harmon Kardon stereo system because that V8 and the 7spd DCT just made me feel so good and that addictiveness the sound BMW use to make in my brain waves was absolutely magical. Not to mention I gave a ride to Tony Robbins and to see him smile made me smile and he loves BMW's and he got into an accident way, way back when he use to drive the 745Li and it saved his life. Anyway, this car looks bad ass and I know it is the car to own and I feel bad for the foolish people who think a Toyota Prius, Honda Civic Hybrid or any other car does them justice somehow. Graham if you get the Roadster after you give a ride to Kevin, I would love to be a passenger in your new ride next year. I am more than willing to drive up from San Diego to your neck of the woods and perhaps we may run into Joe or Jay driving around Los Angeles in their new Roadsters as well.

1. They are only a steal in the US, in europe we pay way more for them.
2. They are constantly connected to the web/gps. (not safe, plus you can in theory get hacked when you drive in the future)
3. I find it amazing not more people mentioning that, when you have a Tesla, you do not in fact own it after the circa 5 year warranty. What I mean by that is that, it is only allowed that you then pay Tesla to fix the car and only Tesla can provide the parts. This may sound sweet and innocent, but it means that you end of paying at least 2-5x more for repairing it.
4. It has so many moving/modern parts that you will have to go like 2-5x more to get small bugs fixed that do not get fixed with the update.
5. Tesla and the government can't track where you are and where you drove the car. (no privacy)
6. If the screen get's black or does not work, you do not have AC and you cannot see how fast you are going.
7. I do not trust the car card/key solution, it seems like something that easily can be hacked if you really researched it.
8. Teslas are also known for having really cheap interior that looks cool and it comfortable, but simply doesn't last like a normal car. Expect wear and tear of seat within like 1/3 of normal seats in normal cars.
9. Also what happens when the battery dies out after the warranty, most electric cars cost about 10.000 dollars to fix that, some even 30.000 dollars. I would not want to have to deal with that.
So all in all, yes it is a fun/cool/practical car.
But having an EV myself, I can tell you that, when you recharge at these fast rates, you have to expect the battery being killed 2-3 times faster. 150-250kw reharging rate is seriously going to kill a lot of batteries. I only recharge at 50kw with my car, and I can already feel after 2 years how it reduces my range.
Also it has to be mentioned that, if you have any EV car and you fast charge it 1-3 times everyday, and you have a very hot climate, that battery is just toast within the first 5 years, absolutely guaranteed. And yes many do cover that. But also a really problem is that most manufactors only cover up to 100.000 miles battery guarantee, this is horribly low.
My personal experience is that the tesla 3 is a good car for people in the city that recharge at home in the US, yes if you are in that category and like most people in the world do not care about your privacy and want all the newest functions, then fine the car is a good purchase.
I just want to enlighten people and tell them that, what the tesla is doing with the tesla 3, is basically what has happened going from old to new laptops. We lease, we have cool features and we get rid of the car around year 5, which actually is pretty bad for the environment. So personally living in europe, I just use my nissan leaf car because I know from several owners that it will last for a much longer time.","Real HIFI Help","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjBSY6c76GM-6O5IISlixuixEi7dOz_VEVK4H-i=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCauHcNMfDgZG-r0gZn1ZcCQ","UCauHcNMfDgZG-r0gZn1ZcCQ","0","0","2020-06-06T08:40:59Z","2020-06-06T08:40:59Z","UgzR4As3ULxKVemz5MR4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"I'm not so sure it's fair to quote government kickbacks and tax deductions in the analysis. Sure it reflects the true cost of ownership BUT one can get a tax deduction on ANY vehicle so it's not like Tesla is a special case in that regard BUT it IS a special case that you get the government handout just for buying it. 

What's the cost of ownership without the government funding and tax write off. 

Personally I'm sick of the government picking winners and losers and this seems to be happening in all industries....especially with car makers.....seems every 10 years they get bailed out and that is NOT capitalism........would Tesla even be viable without government tax credits AND bogus carbon credit trading?","therealthreadkilla","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngJcciJ-ZiUlbZGl9V2kaQG-20BNwhskzLI0A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KhHIjldGfz_I_HXZKAv8w","UC9KhHIjldGfz_I_HXZKAv8w","0","0","2020-06-06T03:41:01Z","2020-06-06T03:41:01Z","UgwNW048-wqtWNHpFZB4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Wait. So if you got about 50 thousand dollars from the video about the Model 3, and then I assume at least 10 thousand from selling Tesla stocks, then you could just get sell the Standard Range Model 3 and get the Long Range Dual Motor, maybe even the Long Range Performance if you made more than 20k in Tesla stocks, and it would be like nothing happened. The SR would sell for at least 25 or 30k, maybe even more. You spent 35k originally, so subtract that from the 60k, and you're at 25k. Add the 30k from selling the car, and you're back at 55k, which is almost exactly the cost of the Long Range Dual Motor. Or you could just get a Model Y. A Long Range Model Y is 53k with White Seats and no Full Self Driving. Get a Model Y Graham. *Edit:* A Long Range Model 3 is actually 48k with white seats. A Model 3 Performance is 56k with white seats.","banana551000","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjqhPQPxiN9OFgKxNSsQ9WBGAsn83FQBSyL0g=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC__ktdRpoHa2Xk-KF6eXPug","UC__ktdRpoHa2Xk-KF6eXPug","0","0","2020-06-06T02:52:36Z","2020-06-06T02:56:35Z","Ugx0zhCsjJLX1-e5E1Z4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"You really are charging your Tesla wrongly on long trips.  You do not need to charge back to 90% before moving on.  Rely on the Tesla to tell you how much you need to get to the  next charger.

"- The only needing the phone to unlock the car should come with a warning about not letting your phone’s battery die. LoL, you should carry the card along with you just in case

- The feature of not being able to remove the charging cable unless you open the door or phone is to avoid someone from unplugging your car to charge theirs without your permission, there are a bunch of a-holes who will do that.

- The feature of watching movies or shows on the screen is something that Tesla can easily do but the law prohibits those functions when the car is moving because it is a temptation for the drivers instead of keeping their eyes on the road. Even tho Tesla call their feature “autopilot” is not really a full autopilot, is more of a driver assistant so you still have to keep your eyes on the road at all times.

"So many clowns on the internet saying that Telsa has raised the price on Autopilot. They have actually LOWERED it. Yes, it will rise in the future but before you had to pay $3000 for autosteer plus $5000 for full self-driving.

"Couple of comments to reduce your regrets:
1. To unlock the supercharger cable (8:18), reach over and start to open the trunk. No need for using the iPhone or opening a door.
2. To open the glovebox without using the tablet (10:58), press the talk button on the steering wheel and say ""open glovebox"".
3. To clarify the key situation (3:21), you can leave your phone in your pocket and the car will still lock/unlock without manual intervention.","Patrick Weigel","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjBpLxTiJQFy1HMuY8bYIPf5GtrLCGMFH-7Tih8FQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47A22vsLPBgYulpY7HYYTA","UC47A22vsLPBgYulpY7HYYTA","0","0","2020-06-05T23:39:00Z","2020-06-05T23:39:00Z","Ugzu9M5kEMdDOkfX4Ph4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"What you're doing by charging it with the small 120v charger is extending the life (""maximum range after 10 years"") of your battery pack by a small percentage if you compare the life of the same pack that is always supercharged.  More so if you drive it like your grandparents, think about the area under the curve of the total power input/output rate of the battery pack.   The largest battery pack available would also reduce the effective discharge/charge rate significantly, which is probably the most effective way to get the most life out of the battery pack; consider though out of the gate the OEMs design the battery pack with conservative charge/discharge rates, GM has an 8-year warranty on the Volt packs for example this is how they do it.
California would be an ideal climate to use the car because some of the tesla charger power output would be used to run the cooling system to keep the battery cells in the ""happy"" temperature outside in hot climates and cold climates; of course a climate controlled garage could solve that.","RacingWithParamotors","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjmXY8iGgDaut71htWiRgKq_h31UD5AhZJl3qXq=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRSLx_lPlNjuoj65V_7aEeQ","UCRSLx_lPlNjuoj65V_7aEeQ","0","0","2020-06-05T23:25:41Z","2020-06-05T23:25:41Z","Ugwu8R1F4A24fBcokwR4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Thank you for the review Graham! Glad you have enjoyed the Tesla 3. I put a deposit and waited forever for the ""$35K"" version. Two months before the ""$35K"" version came out (aka $38K), I gave up and got another gas car. I actually enjoy driving, so for the same price I got a 2-year used 400hp luxury sedan. I do use the back seats (kids), so not a whole bunch of 4-door options that outperform the Tesla 3, butI  had to get one. I also would never get auto-pilot either... driving is too much fun. I can't wait for the future of Tesla and other electric cars. I was ready to make the change, but electric cars were not.","Vader Was Here","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni49yPpqY2VkVd1b7DL0ZhvuXPK_P5_kooybcrW=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5XzHqOASGCf9aUWdQ4AiBQ","UC5XzHqOASGCf9aUWdQ4AiBQ","0","0","2020-06-05T23:07:43Z","2020-06-05T23:07:43Z","Ugxv3FVrR7s-Gui7e8p4AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Graham, Elon Musk has stated that the price of the car will keep increasing because he believes it’s an appreciating asset (lol). But do you think this will ultimately affect the price of the pre owned market? When I looked at pre owned models, they weren’t much cheaper than new. Granted, this vehicle is relatively new so it may just be too soon to tell. 

Thoughts?

"Graham! Let me start by providing value!if you encouraged ppl to increase their watch speed on your videos from 1X to like 1.25X or 1.5X would that increase actual watch time and help the algorithm? Also You’ve inspired me to start my own YouTube channel bro! I bought your course and it’s been awesome! I had a question though! I have about 2 small videos up right now that have nothing to do with my upcoming channel talking about real estate investing and personal finance. Should I delete them and start over (only have 6 subs right now) or should I create a new Gmail all together for this specific channnel? My current channel is connected to my most used gmail for business and personal stuff. Thank you! And congrats on 2 mil! I got here at 1.91 but I’ve been loyal ever since 😂🙏🏽","Ben Garcia","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwni80KQCup62YjDs5UIVM-SSkmL50GCax8mS36WZ5Cg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YRX2GaPtp19f-2Kc5LoYg","UC1YRX2GaPtp19f-2Kc5LoYg","1","0","2020-06-05T22:31:04Z","2020-06-05T22:31:04Z","Ugy1Kg6JrJjWqZASs994AaABAg",NA,"wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Mr2 Reviews The additional weight would likely reduce the range by more than the panels can add. The vast majority of the time they would be pointless extra bulk. Panels need to be perfectly aligned to the sun at a specific angle to work at maximum efficiency. Car roofs are curved, so at any given moment only part of the panel would be optimally aligned. Cars drive under trees, in the shade of buildings etc. Just not worth the cost and weight. What would be worthwhile were solar canopies in parking lots everywhere. The panels could trickle charge a car when one was under them, and feed the grid or whichever office, shop or business they were outside when they were unoccupied. Imagine going to work, parking under a solar roof, plugging in and at the end of the day having enough free power added to drive home at zero cost to you or the environment. Plus, your car would be shaded and cooler.","Spencer Wilton","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniZCxy_0MoaAuhCRU6Sp6IxZOz0Bn0c6KjD6w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC20whSLybAJTQyLl68sI8xA","UC20whSLybAJTQyLl68sI8xA","0","0","2020-07-23T01:58:05Z","2020-07-23T01:58:05Z","UgzmG7PlgISYsnEsAtN4AaABAg.9AkaOgzchit9BROdzeY33T","UgzmG7PlgISYsnEsAtN4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

Just think what a 10 year old Tesla - with original batteries - can do. I'm sure it can't drive to the shop, without charging twice. So, a weekend may do, just about.

"JOHN KENNEALLY Just get a wall charger. Doesn't have to be tesla branded. In the UK power companies are giving the things away and fitting them for free. Even if you buy one, it's less than £500 fitted. Usually charge at about 7kw so add about 35 miles range per hour charging. Plus, overnight electricity is as low as 5 pence per kWh here, works out at roughly a penny a mile (1.2 cents) less than a tenth the price of a frugal petrol car.","Spencer Wilton","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniZCxy_0MoaAuhCRU6Sp6IxZOz0Bn0c6KjD6w=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC20whSLybAJTQyLl68sI8xA","UC20whSLybAJTQyLl68sI8xA","0","0","2020-07-23T02:15:42Z","2020-07-23T02:15:42Z","Ugw9PwKsy0EZ-EbSx-l4AaABAg.99u9sPXSPbM9BRQey3CJIT","Ugw9PwKsy0EZ-EbSx-l4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Xabc Yabc The reason it's not a problem is because you don't drive a full battery or full tank of gas in one day. Most people drive maybe 20-60 miles per day. So if you charge your car in your garage overnight (6 hours) you get 180 miles every night.
Or if you live in an apartment and don't have a garage, then once every week or two weeks you have to charge your car at a supercharger station for 45 minutes. 
So really, it's not that bad.

Absolutely rubbish. In a home environment you are limited by whatever breaker you decide to install in your panel. Your stove is 40Amp and your dryer is 30Amp. I am an electrical engineer and I also happen to own a Tesla.  I've installed my charger off of the same fused 30A disconnect I use for my dryer, which in turn is fed by a 30Amp breaker in my panel. My car, for all intents and purposes, charges in 1/4 the time it takes off of the regular 120 V 15 A charging circuit.  Of course the output of the power supply is time variant/switching DC capable of just cutting the total output DC current in half. You asked how fast it charges at 220V as opposed to 110V, I answered you. I guess I could have told you that it's up to you, but instead I told you the rate at which mine actually charges, and why.","Tailored Reaction","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniCl8VHA6NJfkOId0oluzsvLuWgr26XlSyQgg=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPNlGPG9R-CUylaH--X0-Q","UCaPNlGPG9R-CUylaH--X0-Q","0","1","2020-09-18T17:32:10Z","2020-09-18T17:32:10Z","UgySoFjaJhWDEg8-gyd4AaABAg.99ipUvgVzX69DkprIKjD8Q","UgySoFjaJhWDEg8-gyd4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Factor in that build quality is suspect and the warranty on these is notoriously bad. They will call pretty much any issue your fault due to ""normal wear and tear"" and the customer service is horrible to deal with. You also are not allowed to try to fix anything yourself, no matter how minor it may be and you have to work with their dealers and their vendors. Its a cost that many people ignore, but a big reason why people like the other luxury car companies. They make ownership very nice for their customers. My genesis is currently getting routine service done and they came to pick it up from my house and provider a loaner with all costs covered. You won't get that from Tesla. They will just ignore you for a few months and then charge you anyway.","Josh Bachleda","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnihfMa8wtyu1QiRP3mn9G_v2y0eKl_CWER73A=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGbVQqyr9ms4q5KcFSdR9g","UCoGbVQqyr9ms4q5KcFSdR9g","0","0","2020-06-17T15:43:10Z","2020-06-17T15:43:10Z","UgyzQYvLkud8b7v-ibd4AaABAg.99gJKm-RDRX9A0ASYlFAG7","UgyzQYvLkud8b7v-ibd4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Martin Papp Pushing the button will not unlock the charging handle if the car is asleep.   Opening the app or a door wakes up the car, and that is why those workarounds....work,   

Technically, you don’t need to actually OPEN the door.  Pushing the door handle in about 1/4 will wake the car up but not open the door.   Living here in Florida, I typically turn on the AC a few minutes before I leave, which obviously wakes the car up, so it unplugs easily.  If I don’t need the AC or simply forget, a quick push on the back door handle and the car wakes up, and the charger can be removed.","Joe Tomasone","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniFBf1vaWaSdnZbU-PTrOW-IEFbi668qwrG-3KdvQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYKzY1symmgxgzZSWOTuyQ","UCHYKzY1symmgxgzZSWOTuyQ","0","3","2020-06-24T19:43:24Z","2020-06-24T19:43:24Z","UgyrpTmTtQt1XAMYbr14AaABAg.99b_i99FlDr9AIcW9rL2ua","UgyrpTmTtQt1XAMYbr14AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"True, but you have to dig to find this advice, electric car companies are always pushing their range, but for this exact reason I think there should be a ""recommended"" range that they also disclose that reflects optimal distance between charges that will minimize charging time while road tripping. This would give prospective buyers a better sense of how much extra time a trip home to see their parents 600 miles away will cost them. 

Of course, your driving habits will impact range a lot too, and there's no way automakers can account for that. I drive like a grandma and get about 20% further range out of my B Class than its specs claim it can go, but I feel most drivers lean aggressive and hurt their range rather than help.","Joe Hemmann","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj2dBk1IkdoKo6h3V_uHv9I3BBSB5ennfjICA=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJwoNarEB6ZncGT2Y7M_gw","UCtJwoNarEB6ZncGT2Y7M_gw","0","1","2020-06-15T00:25:37Z","2020-06-15T00:25:37Z","UgysBO67qEf5a6sT6Ep4AaABAg.99bRiagAkuV99uNrVYojyj","UgysBO67qEf5a6sT6Ep4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

You want to charge people luxury prices for a car with incomplete, inferior paint that they will then have to spend thousands extra on protecting via full-body wraps or ceramic coating.  Right out the gate, you’re delivering inferior product while charging superior prices.  This doesn’t include the higher insurance and repair costs.

"@Loanword Eggcorn The biggest issue for me with the lack of pain coverage is that the paint is a protective barrier against rust. Even though they use a fair bit of Aluminum, some parts are still steel. Not having paint over everything, especially for states that use salt on the roads, is a real issue. Even if 99.99% is not seen, I bet the salt slurry would find it, stuff practically gets aerosoled when you drive through the Midwest. 

And even aluminum corrodes... it's just not as bad as steel but when salt is present it will speed the production of aluminum oxide (a white paste like substance). Extended exposure to salt will eventually weaken the material.","1stGruhn","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngDXQMsyOwi7xboilwMWmRaKMGLad5queO32Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzKDKoJJP-SGEPnF7esdcg","UCAzKDKoJJP-SGEPnF7esdcg","0","8","2020-06-10T09:51:43Z","2020-06-10T09:51:43Z","Ugy4Wp4zrlZ8fYt1WPl4AaABAg.99YjkGM1IZv99iWfKd_NMq","Ugy4Wp4zrlZ8fYt1WPl4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Ekai Min It can't be 9 times safer than the average driver when the driver has to have their hands on the wheel the whole time and be fully responsible for the vehicle at all times. So the Autopilot is never in full control, the driver is. Tesla does not have Level 5 autonomy, which entails no human intervention or human in the loop. You can't say Autopilot is safer than the average driver when Autopilot is not even capable of driving by itself. Which is why Tesla's claims are complete and unsubstantiated horseshit. The day a Tesla can drive from anywhere to anywhere, in any conditions and all weather, without a human having to intervene or touch any controls, and once it does that for a few tens if millions of combined miles with 99.9999% reliability is the day Tesla can use that data to compare it to the average driver. But as long as drivers are required to have their hands on the wheel and be in control, then the car is not really in control, the drivers are.","ganymede3141","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnga0hNLRoQ9YAYq2_upEVRrPZNFSX4QZC4i0Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhXOjAcTILgrR4BjVenmyg","UCGhXOjAcTILgrR4BjVenmyg","0","0","2020-08-31T02:39:53Z","2020-08-31T02:39:53Z","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg.99YIXcIXHww9D-tRDdM02E","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"
"​@ganymede3141 I don't know whether you've driven a Tesla, but Honda Lane Assist does NOT compare to Autopilot. Not even close. Also, Autopilot is free. FSD is 8 grand, and I agree with you that it's not ready to take over for humans. Maybe it will someday, but definitely not yet, and it pisses me off royally when I see people sleeping or sitting in the wrong seat instead of controlling the car. But a standard Tesla with Autopilot is far better than what you're describing here. Autopilot in heavy rain and faintly marked roads is much more reliable than my Honda CRV on a perfectly marked highway on a sunny day. Does Elon Musk brag and exaggerate? You bet. But he's given us a magnificent car, and it's only getting better.","grobn","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngWh1l3Nsu3r-r4qA-UasmyaA58Lw_4JTdZrQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiivzJvlBrITctOWXHa8Tzw","UCiivzJvlBrITctOWXHa8Tzw","0","0","2020-08-30T17:40:47Z","2020-08-30T17:40:47Z","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg.99YIXcIXHww9CzvjiN3AtW","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Chris Banana Bullshit assertions. Show me the data. Autopilot is a glorified cruise control with lane assist. You can get that in a Hyundai and even a Honda Civic these days. All it can do is maintain speed and adapt to traffic and stay in a lane under perfect conditions and well marked lanes. That constitutes about 5% of driving scenarios. And Tesla only pulls data for highway driving (which is the only place that Autopilot can be used) and compares it to national averages for ALL driving. Most accidents happen in city driving not on a highway. So of course Tesla will claim it's safer, because Autopilot does NOT work in city driving. The numbers they show are cherrypicked and biased. And they say the driver is always responsible for the vehicle. How can Autopilot be safer than a human driver if it requires constant monitoring and supervision and intervention by a human if it goes off the rails? Do you have a professional driver riding shotgun with you all the time ready to take over when you screw up? No, you don't. Tesla's assertions are pure hogwash with no supporting data. It's just propaganda to rake in $8000 from each sucker customer for a piece of software that doesn't yet exist. I dare you to go from one destination to another in your Tesla (a real route, not just 50 feet down your street) without ever touching the controls. What's that? You can't? Because the car can't do it? That's what I thought. In the meantime, stop spreading misinformation and lies about how 'safe' Autopilot is. It's not even close to an average human driver, because it can't even do 95% of the things an average human driver can do.","ganymede3141","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnga0hNLRoQ9YAYq2_upEVRrPZNFSX4QZC4i0Q=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhXOjAcTILgrR4BjVenmyg","UCGhXOjAcTILgrR4BjVenmyg","0","0","2020-07-06T16:30:32Z","2020-07-06T16:30:32Z","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg.99YIXcIXHww9AmAz6QGihI","UgxKh2GkIP0dCvH_MJ94AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Joe Garofalo II it used to be a gear box  fluid change at 50k miles was recommended but after being out for a while and tesla getting back real world wear and tear data they removed that as recommended maintenance. The tesla gearbox is very simple, it's just a single speed with a reduction gear so theres not much to go wrong. They purposely  overbuilt it because they want to have a fleet ride sharing taxi network. You just do wiper fluid, tires, and cabin air filters. Brakes will last at least twice as long because of regen braking (electric motor acting as a generator to use your forward momentum to spin the motor and recharge the battery with that energy). I literally don't use my breaks at all and thats not driving like a granny coasting for a mile, you can actually drive quite aggressively up to stop signs etc and the regen is enough to slow you no problem. Only exception is emergency stops. Pretty great cars, high starting price though but I'd say its worth it as long as it fits your family need etc.","larry Spiller","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjB7MIfhGA40NZkITmRafylDMaCDKEYTpZdvwcNkw=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_PuqAzkGC2lHSwdEH0gx2Q","UC_PuqAzkGC2lHSwdEH0gx2Q","0","3","2020-06-06T02:09:37Z","2020-06-06T02:09:37Z","UgwwSEgS1vvHYBv6sIh4AaABAg.99Y171D2Dbm99YObKHOpJw","UgwwSEgS1vvHYBv6sIh4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"Non-car people don't realize that the engine/motor isn't the only part of a car that needs looking after. With an electric car, you've still got the usual suspension bushings and joints, steering, dampers, etc; but then since your car is so quiet without an engine to mask the smaller sounds, road and wind noise become more of an issue. You'll be hunting down rattles and perished weatherstripping a lot sooner... and it doesn't sound like Tesla's figured out build quality quite yet.","Sideways G","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjxW4TFv9RoRkhsbouBooQQcz-X4mB5a0sy4fTP=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_Cuv-u8nnsle957ppsrVQ","UCB_Cuv-u8nnsle957ppsrVQ","0","4","2020-06-06T00:00:52Z","2020-06-06T00:01:09Z","UgwwSEgS1vvHYBv6sIh4AaABAg.99Y171D2Dbm99Y9sGyQ85K","UgwwSEgS1vvHYBv6sIh4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Sean P Once upon a time, yes. Tesla fixed that a while ago, but a lot of the old FUD persists.

Only real maintenance is basic suspension and tires that any shop can do. Then ever 50k miles you need to flush the coolant, but I've known a few people who do it themselves so I assume shops could too. Only thing you need to go to a Tesla dealer for is when you have problems with the motors or batteries (which is very rare in the newer models) and then you can schedule it all from the Tesla app.

As a gear head, the Model 3 ruined all other cars for me. I still appreciate high end ICE cars, but I hope to never go back to driving one everyday.","Andrew Mildahl","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngNzpnSEERvyglQngPzEshIg9435GoLQTI7RIT90-I=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuAqNE_xLZao9KtEgo4Zj9Q","UCuAqNE_xLZao9KtEgo4Zj9Q","0","0","2020-06-06T05:44:59Z","2020-06-06T05:47:23Z","UgxlkDn42WHpcJRh9dR4AaABAg.99Y-rCURAZJ99YmFhd5J5r","UgxlkDn42WHpcJRh9dR4AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"

"@Goeycow That's a really interesting point you touch on. A lot of the Tesla enthusiasts are really more tech enthusiasts, rather than car enthusiasts. I used to be obsessed with Tesla's myself, but then switched to being much more of a car enthusiast. I still find them to be interesting vehicles, but they've taken much lower on my priority list than they once were. There's a lot of other cars out there that are more enthusiast oriented than a Tesla.

It was a weird and interesting experience meeting another Tesla tech enthusiast in real life (this was after I made the transition from Tesla enthusiast to car enthusiast). He was happy to talk about the ins and outs of Tesla vehicles to no end, but as soon as I mentioned another car I could tell I had lost him in an instant.

Not that I'm trying to say there's anything wrong with Tesla tech enthusiasts, but it's amazing to see how drastically different they are from the rest of the car community.","Bertinator3000","https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhl8niMI_eqg8AigzZy-RIK0JGFMhdBEtHsuQ=s48-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj2aLImkPC1wMhj7uj0HRnQ","UCj2aLImkPC1wMhj7uj0HRnQ","0","2","2020-06-05T23:37:33Z","2020-06-05T23:37:33Z","Ugwq6bDe1TwPNKLrdT94AaABAg.99Y-gYOP7Q-99Y7CTKt7yQ","Ugwq6bDe1TwPNKLrdT94AaABAg","wqFX9iCqDvc"
