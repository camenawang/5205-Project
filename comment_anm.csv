Can you show what the more relaxed walk looks like (the one before the training walk) if a dog hasn't learned to stop pulling?  Is Inertia allowed to pull during this more relaxed walk? Does that negate the training walk? We sometimes actually do need to get somewhere with our dog Potet, but don't want to undo the little steps forward in our training.",2021-02-27 19:20:41

My dogs are 20 steps behind Inertia (just got them 3 weeks ago), but they pull even using the Slip Rope Leads. We stop every time they pull (walking them separately) and wait till the come back to us releasing the tension themselves, then we reward with a treat. We've tried to use the Freedom harness and the Easy Walk harness and they pull uncontrollably - like they don't feel any resistance so they just want to pull. Advise on harnesses would be helpful.

Do a uturn in front of the dogs face and walk opposite direction. Important to cross in front of the dogs face. Its forces them to look at you and follow you.

Do the uturn in front of them and then make them sit. When they sit continue. This forces them to see you and follow and it teaches that you lead when you dont move till the sit. Treats when they are staying by your side and look up at you. And treats when they sit.",2021-01-25 08:33:47

When we go for walks he wants to out everything he isn't supposed to eat in his mouth which I have to then take it out of his mouth, which isn't always easy. During the walk he wants to always go chew on the trees or whatever and he will dig in and not pay attention to me. When were close to home he gets HYPER excited and tries to sprint, lunge, and then bite me. Jump up and bite my hands, bite at my feet, pull at my pants and just get aggressive. 

Have any of you experienced the same thing as I have? How do I try to fix this? When he's riled up he gets aggressive with his bites and I can't get him to calm down without putting him in his bed and leaving him alone for 10-15 minutes.

He has a lot of energy so I need to go on walks quite often or go on a bike ride with him, he pulls on the leash a lot so that is why I want to try out this video. But if I am done with one training session, he will not have reveived nearly enough exercise, so I will have to take him out for a proper walk where he would then of course pull on the leash since he has only had one training session for example. If the training session is done, and I go for a long walk, should I continue this training or can he then pull on the leash since the training session is over? Or will this take away everything he trained,?",2020-10-19 22:14:31

I never had success with this very soft approach and not all dogs are the same but being firm and strict with dogs is not a bad thing, Dogs do well with a strong leader and not someone who is begging them to do something...Cesar Milan's style is a bit more my method and I've had wayyyy more success being firm and not begging my dog to do the smallest of task but instead let them know that they have to do it",2020-07-30 16:26:47

No matter what your dog‚Äôs problem behavior is‚Ä¶



Be it jumping, peeing inappropriately, aggression, pulling on the leash‚Ä¶or whatever‚Ä¶



There is ONE SOLUTION that can help STOP this problem now



The sad fact is‚Ä¶



Most Dog trainers miss this solution entirely.



They give you cookie cutting training programs.



They use outdated and ‚Äòmean‚Äô dominance techniques.



Or worse yet‚Ä¶



They have no qualifications and are complete phonies.



So what‚Äôs the answer to stopping your Dog‚Äôs behavior problems?



In 4 simple words‚Ä¶



Discovering your dog‚Äôs hidden intelligence.



Let me explain‚Ä¶



In my 10 years as a certified trainer‚Ä¶there‚Äôs ONE BIG LESSON I have learned.



More intelligent dogs are better behaved.



A More intelligent dog takes commands easier



‚Ä¶and understands what you need from them.



The good news is‚Ä¶



No matter how clever you think your dog is.



You can >>>unlock their hidden intelligence quickly and easily.

I‚Äôll explain everything on this page.



Don‚Äôt waste a second longer coping with problem behaviors you don‚Äôt need to be dealing with.



PS Check out the brain training for Dogs course now. It‚Äôs great for eliminating any bad behaviors by tapping into your dog‚Äôs hidden intelligence.



PPS- check out the cool dog pictures on this page.",2020-06-18 03:48:37

I didn't realize until I did the actual research how backwards those training methods are. I've read books by Ph. D's of animal behavior, who advocate positive training. Ive also read and listened to Dr. Mech who did a 40 year study on wolf behavior. In his later work, he has reversed his theory on ""alpha/dominance"" , and has asked publishers to stop printing his previous findings. So please, do your own research. Cesar loves dogs, but his methods set back dog training 30 years.

"Ugz9Mb3DQGUMzAIQhBZ4AaABAg","UCgAmzgU-R9eo9yNY79LYrHA","RicoLen1","We rescued a year and a half to two year old Great Pyrenees a few months back and training him has been challenging. In the past we've had much more people pleasing dogs like Golden Retreivers, & Bichon Frises who were extremely easy to train. I just tried a few of the techniques I saw here, and as soon as I opened the front door, he stopped being receptive to treats. He wasn't interested in them, and even if he gave me his attention, and I offered him one, he wouldn't eat it. He followed me well in the house, but that open door was a whole new level for him. Even after I shut the door, and brought him back away from the entryway, he still wasn't receptive to treats anymore. He'd either look at me, or the door, but not eat. I thought maybe he might just not be hungry, but as I was putting away the leash, and taking off my shoes, he sniffed the treats out in my pocket and wanted one. Because I was curious myself, I let him have one and he ate it up just fine.

What now??? The best I can figure is to try this again tomorrow and hope for better results. I'm not a dog trainer, and I've never had such a stubborn dog before, so I'm still trying to figure all this out. I know Pyrenees are supposed to be stubborn, but man, that was an understatement. We'll take him for a walk, and as long as we're some place new, he'll walk pretty nicely. He doesn't pull much at all, and stays with me fairly well, but when we go to a place he knows well, like the trail around the local lake or around the neighborhood, he'll pull every which way, or alternatively, lay down and refuse to move at all for several minutes at a time.

He's a sweet dog, as I type sitting at my desk in front of my computer, he's got his giant chin resting on my elbow looking at me wondering why I'm not giving him more attention and/or maybe treats, but I'm starting to get frustrated with his stubbornness. After the 3 months since we got him, he's only marginally improved on the leash, and I'd like to be able to take him out without a couple ten minute breaks in the middle of our walks.

Any constructive advice would be welcome.",2020-05-18 21:28:50

I know that it gets very frustrating when walk training andthe dog is not listening or is fatigued I get it but really though use less words . Also in my opinion your dog should always be walking the side traffic is not and use commands like ""uh-uh"" or ""hey-hey"" or ""slow down"" to correct behaviors instead of saying the dog's name a bit aggressively so she doesn't relate her name to bad behavior or treats because I want to not have to bring treats everywhere and everytimei go for a walk lol you even said u didn't wanna use alot when outside then switched to  rewarding  . I just wanna throw this in , when i start to walk out my front door with my dog  I do the same thing have her wait in the door way ,step out sit then I close the door and when I take that first step and she pulls my arm off I say ""hey-hey"" .. then turn around go right back in side take her harness and leash off, put it up  go sit down making he dog think the walk is done for 5 min later say do u wanna go on a walk and put harness and leash back on then repeat the steps close the door and take that first again and if she pulls again for one second I turn right back around and do it again . Took about 5 redos till she realized she's not the leader . When they try to get away with leading because of a dog , cat , human or poop I make em ""wait"" ( stop walking sit and stay ) back track a few step the continue and when they following again I give heavy verbal praise no treats . Only using treats and multiple different treats like kibble dog treats and lunch meat  when doing off leash recall training or correcting dangerous behavior like chasing something across the st so if they hear me say their name aggressively along with a  command like COME  or HEEL or LEAVE IT they won't think oh shit I'm in trouble they will think tuuurkeyyyü§§ and that's when I would use a high value treat likelunch meat  and kibble for things like jus recall when playing fetch and dog biscuits for if she loses interest in the kibble .

 I have a few questions :

I have always been told when you train a dog commands, to Give the command ONCE and show the behavior desired after that to let the dog know the FIRST time you say the command is when you want it done. have also been from the school of thought that using a Rolled leather collar is best. That being said, with the method you have used, how does the dog learn to do the command  when asked vrs whenever they feel they are ready to do it.

But I WILL say, a lot of dogs do not respond to this ""whenever you're ready"" approach. As the ""leader of the pack"" for a lot of dogs you have to reinforce that you ARE the alpha, and they need to trust you. For my dog, I had to be a lot harsher. She's a GSD, and is VERY wolfish. To get her to respect me, I had to have a harder hand. If she didn't do what I asked, and I knew she KNEW what I wanted, I would let her know that wasn't acceptable. A ""I don't want to listen to you right now "" is not okay. And to answer peoples questions, no I do not hit my dog. I am just very very firm. For a lot of dogs, this gentle, treat led approach is just not enough. You also do NOT want to let your dog start relying on treats, because they will start to get vindictive if they don't receive it. The basics of dog training is you want to make life as easy and secure for THEM as you can. They should listen to you REGARDLESS of treats, because if God forbid something happens to you, they need to be as adoptable as possible. And they also need to have faith in you as the alpha.

Disclaimer:  I know many people will get angry by the comments that will follow because many viewers are probably subscribers to this gentleman in the video.  But like I said, I have to save people all the painstaking hours I wasted learning to train my dogs.


So here is what I learned.  There are two camps of dog training: 1.  positive only 2. balanced.  This channel is an example of positive only.  The philosophy behind this method of training is that you do not give the dog consequences ever.  This sounds nice, BUT DOES NOT WORK.  I promise you, I wasted like 2 years.  Balanced dog trainers use rewards for good behavior and corrections for unwanted behavior.  Works every time.  Less confusing for the dog.  Most balanced trainers do not respect trainers such as this person for a couple reasons.  First, when you truly think about it philosophically, there is no such thing as 'positive only.'  As soon as you put a leash on a dog, you are giving the dog a consequence simply by putting a leash on it.  So, the balanced training camp believes these types of trainers are dishonest in their marketing.  Second, balanced trainers know this type of training does not work.  


I am not a dog trainer.  I have no affiliation with the dog training market and make no money from any of this.  I am simply a normal pet dog owner who spent several years learning this DOES NOT WORK.  Good training channels:  Solid K9 Training, The Good Dog, Robert Cabral, etc.  Essentially, anyone who falls into the 'balanced training' camp, if they are competent, is better than this philosophy.  I learned how to train my dogs for free to a very high level from the channels I listed above.  Your welcome.",2020-03-27 02:56:04

But I got to say I don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt have her better trained to walk on a loose leash without pulling?
Since you‚Äôve had her since she was a little puppy eight weeks old, I‚Äôve had dogs to where they were walking on a loose leash good within a week even as an eight week old puppy.
But my methods are different than yours as long as they‚Äôre on leash they need to not pull, that‚Äôs pretty much their job when they‚Äôre on leash for me.
And I don‚Äôt use a harness just a regular collar or a Martingale collar depending on if it‚Äôs a scared puppy. If they‚Äôre a small dog I do use a harness.
And also I find it more exciting and fun for the puppy if they‚Äôre not tired, when I go to train them and then I let them off leash to play and have fun and wear themselves out, after training as a extra big reward!
My first puppy when I was a teenager  I was healing my puppy off leash at three months old, in a distracting 
area in the park, and to the park he would heal on a loose leash.
And I want them to be focused on me as well with the watch me.

Inertia knows  that if she is persistently producing undesirable behavior, Zak will cave.  She then gets the self reinforcing positive stimulus of huffing  poop scent, while simultaneously getting food rewards.  Meanwhile Zak's ego leads him to believe he is helping someone , whille training his puppy.  When, actually, she is training himm to tolerate a scent cone of disgusting feces 18 inches away, while she teaches him to sit, stay, and feed.   How many viewers  will end up reinforcing poor behavior while they sit in a pile of stank, because Zak taught them that it is the ""revolution"" of dog training?",2020-01-20 16:00:01

"UgxwQVtfRmU6BITnr794AaABAg","UCy3LKlaEx2Q3NKghjze5JYA","Glenn Davey","""I could never trust my dog off the leash, he would run away and I would never see him again"" is probably the saddest thing a dog owner could ever say. Your dog wouldn't STAY with you even out of loyalty? ""No he's silly"". YOU'RE SILLY, KAREN and your dog is a pot plant to you.

I walk my dog off the leash everywhere and just use voice commands. Today as he was bouncing along beside me he found a new friend on the street, a hobbling grey old mutt of a similar breed. I remarked to the owners on the breed, and they said ""Yes but our girl is a fair bit old than yours, she's 13. How old's your pup?"" And I looked at them and I said, ""He just turned 13"". All I could think is that most dogs live a very slow, waddling lifestyle, living inside, and then walking on leashes, and get neither enough exercise or the training to build a reliable dog, or the freedom to explore and be a real animal. Most dogs live pretty average, un-stimulated lives compared to my little rescue genius.",2020-01-11 13:07:30

Background info: We rescued the puppy in December. She is around 4 to 5 months old. She is doing great at Leave it, look at me, we are progressing on sit this week. Luckily, we have a big yard so I take her out for potty training without a leash which is not ideal as she is usually way too far from me when she is peeing or pooping and I have to run to her to give her a treat or call her to give her a treat. If she was on leash, it would have been  better. However each time I put the leash on her, she just would not move an inch. I tried just putting the leash on her and leaving it on her during the day so that she can get used to it but it is not working.

You're not helping your dog at all by having pressure being pulled across the sternum/clavicle/chest and under their elbows. You are still at risk for choking them because their trachea is still getting crushed.
You use a harness when you wanted your dog to be able to have full range and power of their front legs (where they have all their strength). Ya know, so they can grip their paws into the ground and *pull their sled/cart*.

It's not hard training leash pressure and if he had done this when his dog was young he wouldn't still be working on this issue. If you people want proper training try watching Robert Cabral or Larry Krohn on you tube and then you will realise Zaks a freaking joke. I bet his dogs gonna be the same bad mannered dog in a years time.

Practice at home walking her either inside or in your yard /garden if you have one. When she walks just a little bit tell her ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and give her a treat. Each time she walks a couple of steps ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and treat. When she does a couple of steps reliably, increase the number of steps before ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and treat.  Keep it going.  Don‚Äôt train for longer than 5 - 8 minutes to prevent boredom and finish with a game of tug or ball throwing. Eventually, she will walk longer and you can treat less but, less treats means more praise, so praise her often and treat occasionally. When she is getting the message, take her outside and do the same. You may have to go back a couple of steps as outside the home is a different environment.  Remember the 3 Ps with dog training. Patience, persistence and positivity.  Love from the UK.",2020-07-10 18:10:59

Zak has a number of cool vids on loose-leash walking. Try to get your dog's energy out as much as possible before walks such as fetch. You'll still want to watch videos or, possibly even better, get a trainer, but you want to start out inside practicing using leash, then to backyard or driveway, then progress to walks.

Ultimately though, as one of the trainers at the dog training school I go to says, every time you carry on walking with your dog puling hard out ahead  of you - leading the way - you are basically saying ""that's fine - you carry on - I'm fine with you pulling"".

How would you feel if someone you loved repeatedly gave you a shock to teach you a lesson? There is no need to teach ‚Äòboundaries‚Äô using painful punishments. Dogs learn better through totally positive reinforcement.  Boundaries can be taught without cruelty.  I taught my foster Staffordshire not to pee & poo in my back garden Within 10 days. That‚Äôs a huge boundary because he likes to pee & poo on grass! He gets plenty of toilet opportunities elsewhere. No pain or cruelty involved.

Now I don't correct for potty training with the Command Collar, just put her outside if she has an accident then maybe 10 or 15 sec later depending on if she is waiting patiently or walking around. ( I am letting her walk around to encourage more independence as her separation issue is pretty hard on her right now).

Not a single treat has been used to encourage the basic commands, 

Now for the separation, a treat or 2 to encourage the happiness when alone is the most we have done their. And her treat is peanut butter or a softened bone in her kennel before we leave.

She gets play sessions and praise and has shown no cowardice or saddened eyes when training, understanding what should be done opens the world to go on walks and socialization with people, not other dogs yet besides our Dane, because she does not have her second round of vaccinations, 

And a ""Good Girl"" perks her up lol

This type of training works im telling you, and done properly makes the dog even happier and able to do more.",2021-01-11 16:49:16

Hitting a dog to get it to stop barking works, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs positive punishment so it would. But it‚Äôs still shitty to do. Correcting a dog at all is also considered positive punishment. Adding something to decrease the likelihood of a behavior recurring. Just because it works, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay. I didn‚Äôt look at the video, but I‚Äôm going to make the assumption that the dog was either panting, had it‚Äôs tail low and did fairly strong short wags in that position, avoided eye contact with the handler, had its head down, looking away from the handler a lot, avoiding them (leaning away, looking away and avoiding eye contact), or was lip licking or yawning consistently or when asked to preform behaviors. Those are behaviors that usually indicate low confidence, insecurity, fear, or being nervous. If they don‚Äôt show these, okay. I don‚Äôt care. If they do, it further proves my point. If you don‚Äôt want to listen to me, here‚Äôs a study.

https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2013/06/the-end-for-shock-collars.html?m=1
A test done on 3 groups of dogs where one group was trained using shock collars.

This is a little example about how punishment results in stress. Ignore me if you want though. Just please avoid spreading this outlook. It‚Äôs not healthy. And no, I do not support Victoria or Zak as neither of them even use markers correctly.",2021-01-04 18:20:02

Lots of people do, and it's not usually an issue until you have a nervous dog. If he loves his normal meal time or play time, pull out the leash/harness first then put it away and do the favorite thing and make a fuss. Slowly, re-introduce putting the leash/harness as a positive/fun thing. Then he wears the harness during games/feed time, then you put it on and ""walk"" to the front door for a couple of days until he is relaxed doing that. Then you go into the front yard for a couple of days and slowly move down the street ALWAYS ending on a positive with a big fuss. Try to end the walk session before he starts to stress.

Smells from people drudging things under their feet, half eaten food or rubbish (Depending on place) or even the biggest distraction: dogs having peed. Walking in the middle of a quiet road is much less distracting and a great way to start, helps your dog focus on you and doesnt make it even more difficult than it needs to be. After a while you can move on to training on the pavement. 
As for the people saying its more dangerous, obviously one needs to use their common sense about how and when to do this. As for the not running to the road, ideally one learns recall as well as emergency recall, boundaries (the pavement is another boundary) etc.",2020-12-22 11:43:23

In all seriousness though, don't use a fire unless you absolutely have to. There are enough forest fires and pollution as is. You have what it takes, but if you go online and ask people you are plugging in that electric heater.

She peed and pooped, a little, but i was so excited that she actually went outside that i didnt really pay attention to the fact that it was just a very small amount, we go back inside and i turn to lock the door, when i turn back towards Raven i am greeted by the rest of what she should have finished letting go of outside.

As far as military dogs, I never said anything about that realm of training. Zak doesn't claim to train military/police dogs. He's giving free training to people who want to successfully train their PETS at home. 
But those ""powerful and energetic"" dogs have been around longer than prong collars, choke chains, and shock collars. How on Earth did they manage those BEASTS before them?!

Doing actual exercise separately using fetch, tug... Don't walk your dog while they're in training to get YOUR exercise. You both need to get your exercise by other means until leash-work is learned. üòäüíï I think that takes a lot of stress off to approach it that way.... And-- Love you Zak!

I would say to keep at it and start in a small room so she can‚Äôt get too far away from it. The goal is to show her that a leash is not scary and it will sometimes be on the ground and you don‚Äôt have to worry. Another thing to try, do a couple tricks with the leash behind your back, then bring out the leash without acknowledging it, don‚Äôt make it a big deal, just keep doing tricks. If she is skittish, try just having part of it sticking out from behind your back so she knows it‚Äôs there. Also, when you feed her, have the leash on the ground next to her. This will create positive association. And, I highly, highly recommend getting a long leash (15 ft - 100 ft depending on how big your yard is) to put on her when she goes outside. To make this less scary, play fetch with the long leash next to you and one time when she comes back, attach it and immediately throw the ball. Don‚Äôt hold onto it because that could scare her. Gradually, you can start playing fetch in the door way to outside, then put on her long leash, throw the ball outside, and hold onto it. Make sure there is no tension (this is why you should use a long leash so it doesn‚Äôt scare her.) you can start walking outside with her with the leash on, still playing fetch. Then call her from wherever you are and just keep walking forward and calling her, holding onto the leash. Soon you can start playing fetch, then put a short leash on her but do not pick it up. Then when you call her you can try picking it up and walking forward, then calling her. Have her wear the long leash inside the house all day (you must insist that she have it on because otherwise, she will be under the impression that she decides if she gets a leash or not.) Then call her out the front door, as if you were going for a walk. Just hold onto the end of the long leash and she should be fine and have plenty of room to roam. Make it just like going outside in the backyard. You don‚Äôt have to force her to ‚Äúgo for a walk‚Äù but just let her smell things and then call her to see if she will come, maybe play some fetch. This should help! Be sure to insist that she wears the leash inside (the long one) so when you leave the house it‚Äôs not anything different.",2020-01-07 21:43:45

One last question though, when I just put the leash next to her without attaching it, she always move to another location. She always try to avoid getting near it. She will take a few treats and then move away. Do I need to keep at it or do you have another method that I can try?",2020-01-07 07:09:19
"Ugx8tAlnsu_aiv1kiDR4AaABAg.93RnmSClqBD93TAClQYRIg","UC0H0B9fTrvoC4iYnqzsTwtw","Natalie Wainwright","I have had the exact same problem! What I did is first make sure they‚Äôre comfortable walking around with their harness/collar inside the house. After they get used to walking around with it on, start getting them used to having the leash around them. Not attached, but just maybe on the ground or next to them. You want to make sure they dont have any anxiety about the leash (or harness/collar.) Try using food when the leash comes out to make a positive association. Next, attach the leash but don‚Äôt hold onto it. Give lots of praise and encourage them to move around. Then you can try putting on a super long leash, holding onto the end, and letting her outside. She should be fine with that since she has plenty of room to run. You can hold onto the leash anywhere you want. Start at the end, then move toward where it is attached. When back inside, put a short leash on and try some tricks. This can make the dog more used to having the leash. Try doing everyday activities with the short leash on. Maybe feed her while holding her leash. Walk around the house with it on (if she is not ready for this try the ‚Äúcome command‚Äù or treats as lures). Then put the long leash on and go for a walk. She is used to having something hanging from her and knows she has room to roam so she should be fine. Like I said earlier, gradually get closer to where it‚Äôs attached. Repeat these steps over a number of days. The best way to get a dog comfortable is to repeat it. I recommend not making ‚Äúgoing for a walk‚Äù a task or job. Don‚Äôt use heel, because the goal is to get her comfortable, so just let her do what she wants if she is on the leash. If she wont walk, first call her and if she doesn‚Äôt come, you may have to pull her a bit until she understands that she must go where you go. Hope this helped! Reply if you have any more questions :)",2020-01-06 22:19:14

What worked w my puppy was to completely stop and ignore the dog. Look up so the dog clearly sees you are ignoring. Start turning in a slow circle away from the dog if it just stays clamped but stop completely again without acknowledging the dog if it starts growling. Last resort for me  would be distract w hands or a toy but do not give either to the dog. Here's the important part: only when the dog let's go, then ask the dog to sit or perform some other trick and then,  when they have done it, reward. You want to associate the reward w the trick the dog is doing and not w the biting. Hope that helps.",2020-01-06 09:15:13

Zak looks like a positive only trainer wich is good 95% of the time but you need that 5% for corrections and If needed punishment and I dont mean hitting the dog or shouting foul language but a time out in the cage or a 15 minutes on there place mat so they know when there wrong and what's acceptable behaviours.

Having said that however, I don't think Maddog was questioning the quality or size of the treats which you give Inertia. I think the concern is more about frequency and is the treat given sometimes unnecessary? That's the way I feel,  perhaps if you just sit down some quiet evening and watch one or two of these recent videos you may see it too. I'm also thinking of some dear folks who maybe have just gotten their first puppy and are following in your footsteps, and how it may begin to cause some health concerns with their pups by overfeeding, or even financially overbuying treats to train when not necessary. Please look at today's video yourself and see how many times you took a step or two then treat, then a few more moves then treat (over 150 times treats were given in this vid). You're a good guy Zak, and you mean well, and you are great fun to watch.

You simply want 1/2 pea-sized treats or smaller. So that if you want to reward extra you can give multiple pieces without giving too much. Hope that helps",2020-01-05 19:08:01

She's very quick to learn, but also very hyper & into everything. The rewarding with treats works sooo good. And she requires lots of playtime, & walking & running sessions.  Keeps me in shape too... 

What brand, & type of treats are being used ?

This is the best trainer I've found on youtube..  & I appreciate everyone's helpful responses also. üòç",2020-11-05 22:36:20
