Meanwhile, realistically you're getting a fast food order anywhere from a minute and a half to 13 minutes and 13 is only if you order fried chicken that isn't already cooked. We are expected to get every order out in under a minute and a half, not that it's reaslistic to expect that. But honestly, Ramsey wouldn't know jack about fast food any more than I could make one of his signature dishes without a recipe. You know that man doesn't eat fast food, not when he's so critical of greasy spoon places and turns them into gourmet trashery. Notice how most of those transformed restaurants went under faster than they previously had. The food they had before was great, the prices weren't. With the exception of the ones that had rotten food and disgusting kitchens, most of the places were actually decent BEFORE Ramsey came along. And there's no way he really just cooked popcorn directly on the flame of the stove, which would be much hotter than a convection stove, as soon as you set the pot down on a convection stove, the popcorn burns and sticks to the bottom, so the pot has to be hovered over the element. His pot would have been full of black if it was directly on the flame.",2021-02-28 09:29:35

His wife, hard at work, worries about him cheating on her with the next door neighbor. The wife takes on extra hours to start supporting their son through college early, and ends up coming home late and exhausted everyday. Too exhausted to eat Gordon‚Äôs food and watch Netflix with him. Instead, she just goes straight to sleep in half her underwear and the plain white undershirt she went to work in. Gordon wakes her up constantly, saying that she doesn‚Äôt love him. Eventually, out of feelings of neglect, Gordon goes to have an affair with the next door neighbor. His wife eventually finds out months later. This leads to a downfall in the relationship. The wife comes home even later than before. It started off with her just being drunk, but has led to an abusive relationship. She beats Gordon and asks Gordon and their son to get her beers. The son tells Gordon to leave her, yet Gordon can‚Äôt bring himself to leave her because he loves her too much. Blinded by his feelings off affection, Gordon allows the everyday toxic situation to go on for about 2 years, until eventually the son confronts the mother, beaten to bruises, and Gordon can‚Äôt take it anymore, and eventually works up the courage to leave the wife and divorce her. Gordon gains custody of the son, but is left broken. No, Gordon has been broken since the day he started feeling neglect from his wife and made the decision to cheat on her.

The ability to trade the different types of binary options can be achieved by understanding certain concepts such as strike price or price barrier, settlement, and expiration date. All trades have dates at which they expire.
When the trade expires, the behaviour of the price action according to the type selected will determine if it‚Äôs in profit (in the money) or in a loss position (out-of-the-money). In addition, the price targets are key levels that the trader sets as benchmarks to determine outcomes. We will see the application of price targets when we explain the different types.you can simply invest with us on our binary options with  gorge smith",2021-02-19 00:45:05

And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacarfice so when we die we can enter Heaven and know him.

And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacarfice so when we die we can enter Heaven and know him.

How long the vacuumed food can stay fresh is related to the power of your vacuum machine (measured by the pump capacity and vacuum degree of your machine. Power is at least 70-80 Kpa, ie 0.70-0.80 Bar (0.07). - It can be referred to as 0.08 MPA) so that you can ensure that the hard and solid products are better cut off from the air. Inovatif Elektronik Makina Sanayi ve Tic. Ltd. ≈ûti. www.inovatifsan.com Delaying spoilage in fresh foods basically depends on 2 conditions. 1- Heat condition and 2- Contact with air. If you can completely cut off the contact of Fresh Food with air and keep this food between 3-7 degrees, you can extend the freshness of the food up to 6-7 times. (This also depends on the type of food. For example, we have seen that this period can be more than 1 YEAR for some types of cheese, thanks to our tests) Also, if your machine can work with all types of bags. (www.inovatifsan.com For example, the products here are like that) You may have made a more sensible shopping in the medium and long term. (flat bags are now at least 5.5 USD cheaper than serrated bags. So even if you use 2 kg bags a month, the machine that works with plain bags will pay for itself in 2 years almost before the warranty expires (if you use this machine in a refrigerator bag, consider your profit :)) Also, the maximum size of the serrated bags is 30 * 40 cm. Important note! )  Respects.",2021-01-29 22:41:06

I've made popcorn for over 25 years and learned from an amazing man with similar experience before I met him.  
Distribute the oil, keep things moving until you decide the process is over, and top with popcorn salt (because it is ground into a very fine powder and coats the popcorn better) or other very fine topping.  This is the way.",2021-01-19 03:44:16

The odor and taste of burnt popcorn is cloyingly strong.  It's worse than burnt hair for those who haven't had the pleasure.  If you burn one kernel or even begin to you've tainted the whole batch.  DO NOT let the soft lighting fool you: that popcorn and the whole room surely stinks like burnt nasty.

Gordon, I am no good at cooking most things, but I am part of a four-generation family legacy of not just making kickass popcorn, but making money on it - even building an entire snack foods industry on it.  My great grandfather, a chemist, was legitimately known as the popcorn king.  He achieved many firsts in the US for popcorn, which is odd to say, but I am not exaggerating.  It's not a difficult thing, but I've been making the stuff since I was small child.  I am licensed to say you gotta fake it harder than that.  Get a hold of me if you want to learn how to make popcorn in the kitchen... or with a commercial machine, or in your mess kit when you're hiking, or with a model steam engine, or under the hood of your running car.

I just got my husband back through the help of genuine love spell caster dr unity. My name is Emily Sarah am from Tx,USA. My husband left me for another woman, This was just 3 years of our marriage. The most painful thing is that I was pregnant with our second baby. I wanted him back. I did everything within my reach to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster called dr unity, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before 11 hours.

"UgwIeqvpLPSUsQVybBl4AaABAg","UCf-X24RwP9A3a-W0YrJxslw","Emily Sarah","Now You Can Get Your Ex Lover Back After Divorce or Break Up..Even If Your Situation Seems Hopeless.. I just got my husband back through the help of genuine love spell caster dr unity. My name is Emily Sarah am from Tx,USA. My husband left me for another woman, This was just 3 years of our marriage. The most painful thing is that I was pregnant with our second baby. I wanted him back. I did everything within my reach to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster called dr unity, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before 11 hours. He cast the spell and surprisingly 11 hours later my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again.thanks to dr unity . if you are here and your Lover is turning you down, or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact Dr.Unity for help now..

This thought is disgusting. YouTube is essentially making free money off small channels and not paying them a single penny. Yes, these are small channels, but since there's so many of them, YouTube will still make a huge profit off of this new policy. I don't care if YouTube hates us now, it must be said by someone. I urge to our subscribers that we spread the message to all creators, and urge YouTube to immediately repeal this new policy.

I did not believe him and i keep my faith up hoping that one day i will be cured from this horrible disease. One day i saw a post on diabetes forum about a herbal doctor called Dr Abumere on how he cure people from diseases with his root and herbs and i quickly contact Dr Abumere on his email and explain my problem to him and he told me not to worry that he is going to cure me and truly he prepared the herbal medicine and send it to me through UPS and gave me instructions on how to take it. After three weeks of taken the herbal medicine , i went to my doctor for checkup and my diabetes result show Negative and my doctor told me that there is no trace of diabetes in my body and the diabetes is completely gone You can also be cured from any type of diseases by contacting Dr Abumere on his email: doctorabumrer6@gmail.com or WhatsApp him on +2349021975055 God bless you",2020-11-29 19:09:35

This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can‚Äôt even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn‚Äôt even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren‚Äôt for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn‚Äôt have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what‚Äôs really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I‚Äôll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times. This week has been NUTS (too soon for jokes? üòÖ)",2020-11-20 23:46:41

Other stupid thing that is more like tradition of cooks than reasonable. To clean a garlic clove you should put the knife on one side and punch it. Completely stupid and dangerous.


Also is so funny to watch cooks talking about chemistry during cooking. As a food technologist- engineer that I am is so funny. Its like an 1 years old boy tries to count. Thank God, Gordon have a team behind his videos to help him avoid basic school chemistry mistakes. 

He burned the tortija.

Sausages are already over salted and the meat is salty alone, also spiced. 
He put more salt during the frying. 
He put salty cheese. 
And then guess what. 
He puts more salt, on the top.
So you will need 5 liter of water, after consuming this thing. 
Dont try it if you have blood pressure issues. 

Dont forget to mention that the brown colour of croisssants, is due to caramelisation. 
So when you fry them, you burn them. 
Then they became black, carcinogenic compounts.

Also the tasty oil he said is the worst fat of all, lard, in liquid form, from the sausages.

-the a's in ""alfajores"" are pronounced like the u in ""us"", but a bit more open.
-the l is further back in your mouth, without arching your tongue.
-the j is like the h in ""happy"" but a bit more closed.
-the o is like in ""horse"" but a bit more closed
-the r is with the tip of your tongue a little before your top front teeth, with much less air going through

The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back soon! Get right with God before it is too late! The Lord loves everyone and wants all of us to know Him and be saved. The good news is that God sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins and after three days God raised Jesus from the dead. Whoever believes in Jesus will be saved and have everlasting life! 

If you believe this and would like to be saved. Say a prayer to Jesus. Confess that you are a sinner, ask Him to forgive your sins, and invite Him into your heart and life to be your Lord and saviour. Live for Him everyday. Read the Word (the Bible) daily and be a doer of the Word, warn others, and keep watch for His return. (Try to buy a Bible, but if you do not have one, here is a link to a free online Bible, https://www.biblegateway.com/ ) 

Have a blessed day everyone!",2020-11-05 10:12:45

My Name is mpirilwe madrene¬† , am 28 and a i just want to share my story i hope it will help somebody who desperately need help like i was!,it doesn't matter whether you believe in Spells or not, but it matters if you really need help!! first of all i want to Thank¬† salongo muvawala¬†¬† and His team for the powerful spells she did for me, i was about to give up on my life and relationship when i lost my man to another girl 3yrs ago,and he was cheating on me very much yet i was faithful in our relationship and i got so stressed because we have a child together he changed in such away that he could not even support our child, it was hard for me to meet all needs.
In my misery and desperacy i sought help from many other spell casters but nothing happened, they promised me results of which i never saw. and i lost money. Until when i saw a post on internet, when somebody was sharing her story, and i liked it and said ok, let me try this one more last time.
I did phone salongo muvawala¬†¬† told him¬† what was happening in my life.she asked me for my names and my boyfriend's names .and Our age¬† and i did so in fear¬† but i loved my man! and after we did the spell on phone, i called him
Friends this is amazing!! i was shocked and literally collapsed when after 2 days of doing the spell, my lost man for 4 months, who never was communicating even he could not pick my calls or reply my messages i sent, called me crying and he began to apologize to me that he did a mistake but he loves me and asking me to come back to me and that he wants to be with us, we are his family, me and our¬†child.it¬†was wow!.
I forgave him and gladly took him in again, and now am happily married with him and our family is doing good, he no longer cheats on me, am so thankful to you salongo muvawala¬† for bringing my hope and life back.
friends if you are in the same situations like i was, i recommend¬†¬† she has guaranteed results within 48 hours. he will help you,just follow his instructions well and change your life,and its unbelievable that we did everything online, just on phone because, I am in mbarara
district and he is in lyantonde. but it worked because he has powers to help people, who are really in Need! therefore i share my story so that somebody might get help,.if you need help, don't stress, contact this POWERFUL MAN , am very sure she can help you as he helped me.

CONTACT HER ON 07061937498 /or +2347061937498

As am not sure whether am allowed here at viewers choice page to publish the website from where i read about her, at least I managed to copy these particular cases he mentioned he can handle

(1) If you want your lover to come back and make him/ her kneels for your love gain, get him back in less than two hours only, he will love you like he never did before and he will remain under your remote control.

(2) Do you want to attract a specific man, to madly follow in love with you, I guarantee he will make him follow you like a magnet, you only need to think of whatever you want him to do, and he does it without any choice, even you never showed him that you love him, nor you are even close to him,

(3) Do you want to stop him/ her from cheating you, talk to him now, he will tune him in your dreams such that you can know everything he/ she does at your back like for example all other girls or men he/ she cheats you with. And stop them never ever to cheat you again.
Hi

(5). Do you want to have many partners without any of the knowing the other, get protected and have freedom of doing everything without others know. He can do it friends.

(6) Do you want to divorce, stop divorce or getting married to your lover, one day results with man.

LIFE PROBLEMS

(7) You want to be promoted in your office. or have your salary increased, talk to me, one month you will have it all.

(8) If you want to boost your business, winning tenders or contracts , contact us

(10) Are things happening to you that you can't explain.

(11) Do you feel you are stuck in the wilderness in a situation that appears hopeless?

You just have to tell this powerful man¬† exactly what u want out of your relationship and he will code it according to your specifications. You tell him properly the tinniest details of how u want your relationship to be don't fear, and will punch in those codes for u. He is so cooperative and will work hand in hand with u until when you are satisfied.

Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see
This, our town of Halloween
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright
It's our town, everybody scream
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
'Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting no to pounce, and how you'll
Scream! This is Halloween
Red 'n' black, and slimy green
Aren't you scared?
Well, that's just fine
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream
In our town of Halloween!
I am the clown with the tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the ""who"" when you call, ""Who's there?""
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
Halloween! Halloween!
Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
That's our job, but we're not mean
In our town of Halloween
In this town
Don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin
This is Halloween, everybody scream
Won't ya please make way for a very special guy
Our man Jack is King of the Pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King, now!
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song

This is a year and 2 weeks since I was delivered from genital Herpes. All thanks to God for using this Great herbalist to heal me. I have promised to keep telling good things about Dr Noah. Please feel free to share Your problems with him and don‚Äôt forget to tell him I did refer you to Him. Thanks.

Or eat leftovers, that is heated proberly in a pan or pot""

Also im really poor, so i mainly live on gazpacho as my only meal, im so thankful my best friend gets me red and yellow tomatoes and bell pebers from their greenhouse.
i like it with crispy bread with grains and with a bit blue cheese just for personal preference. (tell me if that is weird, i like it tho)

I‚Äôm  surprised to read a question like this.

Most of us have been so strongly influenced by the medicine system that we have forgotten that mother nature has created the human body with the inbuilt capabilities to fight & cure most of the diseases naturally.

A person will not get a disease if all his organs & tissues work normally & the passage of solid, liquid & wind matter goes on smoothly through his body.

And in the event of any blockages or disturbances of these passages a proper exercise would release the block. A more specific way of releasing these blockages or activating the week organs is acupressure.
Generally to cure them you have to know what triggers them.??

So, Yes ulcers & many other chronic diseases/ ailments can be completely cured by this wonder therapy called acupressure . For a complete online cure pls contact::::::Dr.Scottwitcher21 @gmail.com.Or text  +1 339 201 9132 ..",2020-10-17 00:54:25

"Ugw9aynbWpn6qEEN0T94AaABAg","UCLVoFdtg3pXJvtZM6YCti-Q","JoshexDirad","Gordon, Gordon, you were lucky with the fried chicken, many times as the chicken cooks the skin will shrink and shrivel down the leg, you forgot the step of gently using your  thumb and index finger to rollback the skin and make sure that part of the chicken under the skin where it's not connected to the meat gets coated in your dry batter. Also at the meat/joint end of the leg or thigh you should lightly pull at the meat which will expose any cracks which you can then massage the dry batter into. This insures no mistakes, complete coverage every time.

Alternatively if you do not want it to be greasy you can also bake it in an oven at 180 C with a small slice of butter over the top. in fact doing so ensures a more crispy coated chicken than you can achieve in a fryer, and often gets reactions like people saying it tastes more like KFC.

3. Acrescente o frango cortado em peda√ßos, tempere com 1 colher de sopa de sal e deixe cozinhar, com o tacho tapado, durante cerca de 10 minutos, sobre lume moderado.
4. Adicione √°gua quente at√© cobrir o frango, volte a tapar e deixe ferver suavemente durante mais 20 minutos. Acrescente um pouco mais de √°gua a ferver de modo a ficar com cerca de tr√™s vezes e meia o volume do arroz. Rectifique o sal, se for necess√°rio, e assim que retomar fervura introduza o arroz. Mexa e tape.
5. Passados 13 minutos, acrescente o sangue, previamente misturado com o vinagre. Misture bem e deixe ferver mais 1 a 2 minutos. Retire do lume e sirva de imediato. Acompanhe com salada.",2020-10-09 16:46:36

It doesn't matter what job you have, it doesn't matter what car you have, it doesn't matter if you are black or white, it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, we are all human, we all have a heart, we all breathe the same, we all bleed the same and the biggest gift we ever got is that we are able to thank God every day for what we have and being able to tell our loved ones that we love them. Everybody take care of yourself and don't let anybody tell you what to do with your life I want you to know that I love and respect every single one of you. üòò 

Value what you have while you still have it because its not garunted that you will have it tomorrow.

Thank God everyday that you woke up and you are breathing in this moment. 
Call your loved ones every morning when you wake up and tell them that you love them cause its not garunted that you will be able to call them by the end of the day. 

Thank God every night that you get to go to sleep and that you are lucky enough to sleep in this bed again and nothing happened to you in the day.

In this life its not garunted that you get to go to sleep again at the end of the day so this is why you gotta thank God for everything you have and especially for the fact that you are breathing

I can list some items per day.
In the morning with ""pho"" near noon you can eat a traditional Vietnamese meal, in the afternoon take a walk on a motorbike to enjoy street food in Dalat and do not forget bread, banh xeo. Evening to the sidewalk bars will not disappoint you. At the end of the day, sit and sip an egg coffee on the edge of the west lake.
There are so many more dishes that I can hardly mention all, it would be great if there was a program of Vietnamese food addiction experience hosted by him himself.

The RT PCR test being used to claim ""cases"", in fact only looks for genetic sequence markers ( a series of code data) that are present in the immune system and DNA (chromosome 8) of every human being, most of the time, when they are eliminating toxicity, which is then amplified in the PCR test, enough times until a match is inevitably found, using a test that its inventor, Nobel prize winner Kary Mullis, has stated should NOT be used for diagnosis of anything.

The President of Tanzania, suspicious of this test, had samples taken from inside a paw paw fruit, as well as from a goat and from engine oil, labelling them as if they had been taken from humans. The paw paw fruit and the goat tested positive for what cannot be proven to exist, while the engine oil was concluded as inconclusive! What a fraudulent scam of a ridiculous farce...

Viruses are created in the body, by the body, intentionally, seasonally, to eliminate toxins from toxicity poisoned cells. They do not create disease, they prevent it and it is impossible to catch a virus from someone else, from an animal or from anything else, which is why none of these absurd claims of germ THEORY, have ever been scientifically proven.

The test is a scam so as to create false-positive ""cases"" of healthy people who test positive for their own immune system and DNA, required to seemingly justify further lockdowns and further absurd restrictions and violations of our inalienable freedoms and rights.

Being fooled into taking tests that cannot test what they claim they are testing for. for which no scientific proof exists, is only adding to the problem, and is exactly what the orchestrators of the PLANdemic scamdemic, want to achieve..


""COVID"" TEST RESULTS explained for Dummies:

POSITIVE: Your body is currently in a toxic state, due to your exposure to toxins (including vaccines/ pollution/ Harmaceuticals/ cosmetics/ cleaning products, food additives etc), poor diet, malnutrition, EMF exposure, stress/fear, pre-existing medical conditions/ comorbidities and/or lifestyle choices, so your intelligently designed immune system is currently dealing with your self-inflicted & government-caused poor health by creating particles - Exosomes, to deal with and try to prevent further illness. so as to prolong and save your life.

It is these ""positive cases"" that are being used by governments, as reasons for further lockdowns, masks and removal of your freedoms and rights, all of which are causing the planned real deaths, due to the lockdowns!!

NEGATIVE: ( Getting The ""All Clear"") : You are currently not in any/ enough of, the above states of health, and therefore do not currently have Exosomes trying to save your life..

There are only 5 ways to become ill : Toxicity, Malnutrition, EMF exposure, Stress/Fear, Belief..

Invisible microscopic contagious disease-causing monsters (unproven, proofless, disproven Germ Theory) that pass on (infect) an illness that you do not have, do not exist, which is why no-one has ever proven their existence scientifically.. or ever will..

 put a nice dollop of oil at the bottom of the pan put in 3 kernels of popcorn wait for them to pop dump in the rest of your kernels and take off the heat for 30 seconds, then put back on the heat this will insure fully popped kernels and no risk of burnt popcorn. at maxium fluffiness.

"Ugzx2X_KjKQrvAu2n6h4AaABAg","UC7oRBNxsa591C4kWP0mIRtQ","Bless Percy","The reality we can't ignore;

1. When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell.
2. Who goes to hell? those who don't believe at J-sus Christ as the savior.
3. Who goes to Heaven? Those who believe at J-sus Christ as the savior. 

Deserving hell for sins
Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; 
Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH.¬†In Genesis 2:17 G-d warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit.¬†They disobeyed G-d, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later.¬†Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).¬†Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are¬†not¬†the same.¬†Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.¬†The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).¬†All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that J-sus Chr!st got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at¬†The Great White Throne of Judgment¬†and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.¬†

Believing at J-sus does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at J-sus as the perfect sacrifice for your sins.
It's your choice but know that rejecting J-sus will send you the wrong direction.

No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what J-sus Christ did for you as simple as that.

Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

In other words if you want to go to heaven after your death you must confess with your mouth and believe that J-sus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.

After believing at J-sus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.

As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.

Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..",2020-09-26 06:39:15

Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

John 3:16-18 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Believe in your HEART on the Son of God before it's too late!!! 

If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your HEART that God raised Him from the dead. You shall be SAVED!!!",2020-09-25 17:14:39

 ‚Äú For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:16‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚ÄúMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠15:1-4‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2 Peter 3:9 | KJV

DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY 

GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK 
THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!!

Every one of us has broken God‚Äôs moral law, the Ten Commandments; To lie even once makes us liars, to steal even once makes us thieves. & James 2:10 states that to break one of the laws makes us guilty of them all. Problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because the creator is perfectly holy, meaning his standard is outside our reach; & just as he is perfect in holiness, he is also perfect in justice. So sin must go punished, & the wages of sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth

Thankfully God is so merciful, 2000 years ago he sent his son Jesus Christ down from his throne in heaven to this earth, & here he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take on judgment on our behalf by becoming our sin, & dying a grim death on a cross. Before he died, he said ‚Äúit is finished‚Äù meaning, the debt of our sins have been paid. & On the third day, he conquered death & rose up. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement, not by earning it, but as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected

So what we must do in response is understand the magnitude of our sin against the creator, go before him in humble repentance of our old ways through gratitude in his sacrifice, & confess with the mouth Jesus Christ is Lord, savior, & the ruler of our lives from that moment forward. (Romans 10:9). The moment this happens God will grant a new heart, new desires, & eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers. 
This is the most urgent decision all of us will ever make, as it determines where we will spend eternity. & all of us wether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; do not even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed.. & as it is written, (Hebrews 9:27);  ‚Äòit is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, the JUDGMENT‚Äô

All glory, honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ",2020-09-24 23:48:00

But we can find hope and comfort in the reality that Jesus is alive and at work in this world - and in us. Although we still face heartache and pain, we can welcome Christ to walk with us in our tunnel of grief. As the light of the world, He can bring rays of hope to brighten our fog.                                                                    

Dear friend, make it apart of your constant vocabulary to say ""I trust you Jesus"" in everything you think, say and do. Trust Him with EVERTHING in your life. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit! Make today the first day of living in The Light for all eternity. (John 8 : 12) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è                          

Take joy and comfort in praying the following prayer with me....Lord God, thank you so much for being the light in the darkness. Bring hope when I'm sad and confused, and help me see Your glory. In the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ I pray, Amen.",2020-09-24 22:55:45

On top of that, being mushrooms, they don't tend to keep very well for very long. On top of that, the demand for them and the loss of wooded habitats have made them harder to find.

This thought is disgusting. YouTube is essentially making free money off small channels and not paying them a single penny. Yes, these are small channels, but since there's so many of them, YouTube will still make a huge profit off of this new policy. I don't care if YouTube hates us now, it must be said by someone. I urge to our subscribers that we spread the message to all creators, and urge YouTube to immediately repeal this new policy.

- a joke doesnt have to be realistic, most jokes arent beleive it or not. 
- a joke doesnt have to be funny to still be a joke
- a joke doesy need to connect to reality in any way shape and form, thats how some jokes are funny. you explaining why the joke is wrong in a realistic sense takes whatever humour out of it.
good fucking job man.
and after reading more into this
- a joke doesnt need to be smart to be a joke
- most jokes are absurd
- even if it was half assed it was still a joke and didnt need to be corrected on a realistic term. 
its just annoying man.
- there are good jokes that arent realistic
- humour is subjective, so if you think (said joke) is half assed its called an opinion, but like i said with your 300 iq and superiority complex you just cant understand that some people are more right than you are, and you can be wrong too mate.",2020-11-28 05:34:53

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up

Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give, never gonna give

The act of stirring can cause any of three things to happen:  First off, it can knock any loose granules that might be stuck to the side of the pan into the liquefied sugar.  Ideally you want to make sure this doesn't become an issue by pouring your sugar into the bottom of the pot carefully, without letting it touch the sides.  If it does touch the sides, brushing any grains on the side with a wet pastry brush before the heat goes on is best.  But let's say there's an off chance you missed a grain or two, and they are adhered to the side of the pan... it's best not to agitate them off of the side and into the liquid.  It would act as a seed for the crystals to form, like you say.  Similarly, stirring can cause the solution to splash onto the side of the pot, where the liquid evaporates more quickly than the main part of the pot.  It will then crystallize and fall in, and of course a big, dried up flake of caramel also acts as a seed for crystals.  The third thing is simply the same thing happening on the spoon itself.  Putting the spoon in and out creates crystals on the surface of the spoon- it cools and dries when taken away from the heat- and if you put it back in, again that seeds the liquid.  The spoon ITSELF has nothing to do with it.  By that logic, the pot would cause it to crystallize, and of course it doesn't.

And yeah, he does mean small crystals.  Not big ones.  It becomes a very fine grit.  Sincerely, a less-famous professional chef.  lol",2020-10-27 17:33:59

And why, might I ask, are you so adamantly denying that we are not talking about loanwords? Croissant is one, I fail to see how it isn't relevant to the discussion when we're talking about how valid the pronunciation of the word is, depending on how close it is to the native French. Perhaps you could enlighten me.

Also, proper names are a slightly different situation than nouns (or verbs, adjectives, adpositions, whatever) insofar as they are usually attached to human beings, which brings different connotations in terms of pronunciation. In any case, people can't really be fairly expected to pronounce even names natively anyway; English speakers can only do the best that they can when faced with ""Nguy√™n"", for example.

I'm sure you're mature enough to have a civil discussion with throwing out needless insults like ""pedantic"" (which I find particularly puzzling, as I'm not the one insisting that there is only one ""correct"" pronunciation for a single word). We all have lives btw, doesn't mean we can't have a little internet discussion every now and again :)",2020-10-23 18:47:05

Besides, it's a lot more correct than how the vast majority of non-native French speakers do (if you listen, Gordon says it about 3-4 different ways, there's at least some attempt to get it right, albeit inconsistent).

You keep wasting your energy talking about something completely irrelevant to the subject at hand. But if you are on about pronouncing nouns (because I am not talking loanwords) correctly? Yes, because it's common courtesy to at least try and get someone or something's name right.

I have a life and better things to do than deal with a pedantic, obtuse and frighteningly obssessive wankpuffin on the internet.",2020-10-23 18:30:18

In any case, my point still stands, Ramsay aside. I could've left him out and my comment would be the same. 

""Croissant"" is by linguistic definition a loanword, and it's also a noun; the two categories are not mutually exclusive. A loanword is one that originates from a foreign language and is adopted by speakers, eventually being nativised into the language, often to the point that many wouldn't recognise its status as a foreign loan anymore (such is the case with a huge amount of English loanwords). That is not an opinion, that is objective fact.

Again, do you pronounce every loanword exactly as it is said in its source language? If you don't, tis very inconsistent of you to thus complain about how people pronounce croissant. In fact, I highly doubt that *you* even pronounce croissant as a Frenchman would (I am assuming you aren't French), which makes your point even more hypocritical.

I might also add that how jarring the pronunciation is is entirely subjective; someone who has grown up hearing and saying ""kross-ont"" will be equalled as jarred hearing ""kwa-SOHN"" as you are theirs.",2020-10-23 18:21:32

The thing is called a ""Croissant"" - it's not a ""loanword"", it's a noun!  Butchering the pronunciation jars, just like folks that call a Pain au Chocolat a ""Chocolate KrussARNT"" (which defies logic as the former is small and rectangular, if it was a chocolate filled croissant, then they'd be right!).",2020-10-23 18:01:34

You must go around saying ""nation"" as ""nasyoÃÉ"", because after all, that is the ""correct"" pronunciation, right?

No, of course not. Loanwords are routinely (I'd even hazard to say *always*) conformed and reshaped to fit the language's native phonology and phonotactics. There's nothing wrong with that, every language does it (yes even French) and has done it since the inception of language itself. It just makes sense that English speakers would pronounce it differently.

Oh and btw, the pronunciation that Ramsay uses (the one you claim is ""as the French would say it"") still isn't even how the word's pronounced by native French speakers.",2020-10-23 17:53:08

Gordon's good, gotta give 'em that but the man needs to add specificity on why _not_ to do something (i.e. _Don't stir too early, don't open too early, wait this long_ etc.), or maybe, just not say anything at all of what not to do and let the viewer learn from watching when to do something he'd otherwise say not to at the beginning.",2020-09-25 16:05:56
